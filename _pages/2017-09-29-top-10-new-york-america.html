<p>Everyone we know who has been to New York has loved it - I am yet to meet someone who hasn't - and our experience in the "Big Apple" didn't disappoint us.</p>
<p>The only thing we were disappointed about was not having enough time to see everything - however I think you would need to live in New York to really get to know it properly.</p>
<p>We had 8 days in total - and this was enough to give us a good initial taste of the "Big Apple" - and enough to leave us wanting more. </p>
<p>We will be back.</p>
