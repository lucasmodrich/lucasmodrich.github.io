<p>Prior to embarking on our round the world trip back in 2008 (<a title="Hola! The trip begins." href="http://modrich.com/2008/04/16/hola-the-trip-begins/">which you can read about here</a>), I had little interest in international travel - to be honest I really wanted to explore what we have here in Australia.</p>
<p>Very early on into our trip however, I had been well and truly bitten by the travel bug. Now a few years on I've started to put together my travel bucket list - the list of places I would really like to see in my time.</p>
<p>As you can read about in the blog I have already put ticks in some of the boxes, but it's a big world and there are still lots of place I want to visit... and just as many that I want to go back to.</p>
