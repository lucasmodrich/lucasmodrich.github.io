<p>Our whole time in Peru was an incredible adventure, and the jewel in the crown was Machu Picchu. This was something dreams were made of - quite literally. Having been very interested in the Inca's from a young age (including an addiction to the children's cartoon series Cities of Gold), Machu Picchu was defiantly a destination at the top of my travellers bucket list - and once we got there it didn't disappoint! Every inch of this sacred place is post card perfect, and words and pictures do not compare to seeing it in person.</p>
