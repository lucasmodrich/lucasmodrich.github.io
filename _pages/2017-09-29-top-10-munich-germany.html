<p>Munich was what we had always imagined Germany to be from a very early age - it's the essence of story book Germany. While Munich is obviously famous for beer, beer houses, and the Oktoberfest (don't get me wrong this was part of the appeal), I found it to be a very nice, liveable city. Munich marries the old with the new very well. The reason I rate this #1 is based on my answer to a very simple question - Could I live here? The answer (Yes), came very quickly - practically instantly with little consideration required. That said, we were there in summer, and have not experienced a German winter before - so that could well change.</p>
