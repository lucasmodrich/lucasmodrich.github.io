<p>We visited Osaka in late May 2011. This was our first trip to Japan, and surely will not be our last. We were absolutely blown away by Japan and the culture. The cities were very clean, the people were very polite and friendly - even our lack of speaking Japanese was no barrier. One of the definite highlights from our time in Osaka was seeing a local baseball match (Osaka Buffaloes vs Hiroshima Carp). The Japanese appear fanatical about their baseball and the energy once your inside the stadium and the game is underway is amazing - team chants &amp; songs going though out the entire game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I was slack and didn't publish anything on our time in Japan. We have a lot of notes and tones of photos, so I'm hoping to get around to it before too much time passes, and will provide a link here to anything I do end up writing.</p>
