<p>Istanbul defiantly made an impression - and made its way into this list.</p>
<p>What a beautiful city. The weather was magic. I found myself waking early most mornings and heading to the roof top terrace and simply sitting and watching Istanbul come to life as the sun rises.</p>
<p>The markets, the food, the people - all come together to create an awesome travel experience, and one that I won't forget... and will love to return to.</p>
