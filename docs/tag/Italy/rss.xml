	     <h2 id="back-in-rome">Back in Rome</h2>

<p>We arrived back into Rome on Wednesday evening (29th July) in reasonable time after having left San Lupo in the early afternoon - immediately after the main mass and precession of the statue of San Lupo through the streets.</p>

<p>It was good to have made it back to San Lupo again, although not a lot looks to have changed since our last visit in 2008 - but its beautiful during the festival with all the lights lining the streets at night.</p>

<p>The drive from San Lupo back to Rome was fairly straightforward and un-eventful - exactly how I like my drives in Italy to be. The auto strade makes for fairly good driving - especially on the tolled sections. It’s always the last 25-30min of navigation into your final destination that becomes stressful.</p>

<p>Once we got back to Rome, we unpacked and checked into our hotel. We decided it was best to return the rental cars that night instead of hanging onto them for the night and risking damage in the car park - or worse a 2.5hr wait to return the car like it took to pick it up.</p>

<p>The rental car return was as you would expect, and as we had hoped - simple and straightforward - and in under 20min we had returned both cars and were headed for the Fumancino taxi rank. We are now well acquainted with where the correct taxi rank is after our late and frustrating entry into Rome about a week and a bit ago.</p>

<p>After a brief walk we find the taxi rank with 2 taxi’s sitting waiting for us - what could be better? Well it could be better if one of the taxi drivers was actually interested in doing their job - but rather we find one taxi with 3 young people in it, 2 young ladies in the front and a young gentlemen in the back. The other taxi was empty.</p>

<p>Apparently the two young (and somewhat attractive) ladies in the front of the occupied taxi had gained the intrigue of the young male driver - and none of them were interested in us.</p>

<p>So we wait… We lean against the empty taxi making it very obvious that we would like to go somewhere… still nothing. Eventually a third taxi turns up with an older gentlemen who is willing to help us - however when he see’s two other taxi’s he decides to enquire why we didn’t get one of them. The problem became quickly obvious to him. A few rushed words of Italian and one of the girls jumps out of the front of her taxi and asks where we want to go.</p>

<p>The young guy in the back seat jumps out and we pile into the girls taxi and we are off - one of the young ladies at the wheel and her friend in the front passenger seat - apparently coming along for the ride.</p>

<p>The banter in the front seats was endless - and obviously very interesting based on the facial expressions of the friend. Her attention was fixated on what the driver had to say - and thanks to some interpretation from Albert (Laura’s dad) we were able to follow the general gist of the conversation.</p>

<p>Well… apparently the driver had just broken up with her boyfriend Francesco… and it went on… and on… and on…</p>

<p>We eventually got to the hotel and 20 Euro later we parted ways with the young ladies and left them to their less than interesting conversation about Francesco.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was fairly laid back - and after dinner we all turned in for an early night as we wanted to check out of the hotel as early as possible to maximise our time in Rome in the morning.</p>

<h2 id="whirlwind-tour-of-rome">Whirlwind tour of Rome</h2>

<p>After an early breakfast the next morning we met our arranged shuttle van that was taking us, and our many bags, into Rome Termini train station. It was a long drive into Rome in the traffic, but we eventually made it. As it was still early we decided to check our bags in at the train station baggage holding area and head out for some brief sight seeing.</p>

<p>Given the limited time we had, we thought our whirlwind tour should hit some of the major attritions - St. Peters Basilica and the Spanish Steps - conveniently both located on train line ‘A’.</p>

<p>We got out to St. Peters Basilica in no time at all - and the air-conditioning in the Metro trains was a nice escape from the heat and humidity of the Roman streets.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/1fe0e-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Walking up and into St. Peter’s Basilica was quite a sight. It was only us, and 10,000 other people - quite tranquil really…</p>

<p>The line to get into the basilica wound its way right around the main piazza. We didn’t join the queue and were satisfied to observe from the outside and snap a few pics.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/900c1-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We then started to head back to the train and popped out at the Spanish Steps for a few pics before heading back to Rome Termini to pick up our bags and catch our train onto Genoa.</p>

<h2 id="train-to-genoa">Train to Genoa</h2>

<p>The train trip was great - although we managed to score the carriage with only partially working air conditioning - still it was better than none at all.</p>

<p>The train journey was relaxing. Put the mind in neutral for a while and enjoy the scenery passing by. A welcome change to being behind the steering wheel - and to be able to walk up to the bar carriage and have a few quite beers made it even better.</p>

<p>The train line follows the west coast of Italy - so there were a lot of brilliant views of the Mediterranean and the towns and cities along the way.</p>

<p>We arrived into Genoa in the early evening, and checked into our hotel, which was just a short walk across the piazza from the station. On this trip, Genoa is simply a stop over for us - so after a quick dinner (which was absolutely beautiful) we all headed off to bed to get up at 4:30am to catch our next train at 6am.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/bf391-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="the-early-train-to-aix-en-provence">The early train to Aix-en-Provence</h2>

<p>Friday morning we were all up early and met down stairs at 5:15am packed and ready to leave. We had arranged to check out the night before so just needed to drop our door keys with reception and leave. A short walk across the piazza got us back to the train station.</p>

<p>Today we had three trains to catch. The first was a regional train from Genoa (Italy) to Ventimiglia (Italy). The second was also a regional train from Ventimiglia (Italy) to Nice (France). The last was a fast TGV from Nice to our final destination Aix-en-Provence (France).</p>

<p>The challenges we had ahead were related to management of our baggage on and off the trains. Our bags at this point are quite heavy, and numerous. Getting on the first train was reasonably straight forward given the early hour - but as our journey moved on, more and more people joined the train making it more complicated to manage the placement of the bags.</p>

<p>The regional trains don’t stop for long at each station either - so we needed to be prepared - with out bags - ahead of time so we could quickly get everyone (and their bags) off before the train needed to move on.</p>

<p>The first stop was to be the most challenging with only 11 min to change trains - including locating the next train, its platform, and lugging all our bags down and back up the platform steps. Luckily we arrived in about 5 min ahead of schedule that gave us some more time. In the end, the change over was quite straightforward and we had plenty of time.</p>

<p>The next two legs of the journey were also straightforward - however we did notice an increased level of chaos at the French train stations as opposed to the Italian stations. Both Nice and the TGV station in Aix-en-Provence were packed and totally chaotic.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/481a6-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After arriving into the TGV station in Aix-en-Provence (about 20km out of the main city), we started looking for a taxi. Simply you would think - and in reality it was - unless you had two 30kg bags in tow plus a 10kg backpack, 4 other travellers and your 18-month-old son. Apparently we had arrived into platform 1. Taxis were at platform 3. This meant lugging bags up two flights of stairs onto the mezzanine level that allowed you to walk over the train line to platform 3. Most of the stations lifts were out of order. We found one that got us half way up, and reduced the stair climb by 50% - but we had to carry the bags the rest of the way.</p>

<p>The taxi was very easy - we needed two and in about 20min we arrived safely into Aix-en-Provence and at our accommodation - all very tired after the long day, and many stairs we had to carry bags up and down.</p>

<p>We did notice the much more comfortable temperature in Aix-en-Provence. Closer to 28c, and much cooler in the later evening when we ventured out for a walk up the nearby Cours Mir Abeau - a long and grand street which has night markets, cafes and restaurants all the way up. It made for a very nice and relaxed evening walk.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>Saturday we packed up and checked out of the villa. It was sad to leave as its been an absolutely great time and very relaxing, but everything must come to an end and we must move on to our next destination - Alberobello.</p>

<p>Alberobello is in the south east of Italy, not far from Bari - but it’s roughly 750km from where we currently are in Siena, which will make for a long days driving. Furthermore we need to swing by Rome airport to pickup Maddie (Laura’s sister) who will be joining the travelling group for a few weeks.</p>

<p>Also while we are at Rome airport we will continue to try and track down our lost baggage - one small backpack and Archie’s pram. Franco - our host at the villa - was fantastic in assisting us dealing with the lost baggage people at Rome airport via phone - although even he could only do so much. In the end we had settled for the baggage (once it was finally located) to be sent to Rome airport where we would collect it.</p>

<p>We jumped into the cars and headed south toward Rome - a 2.5hr drive. We arrived with plenty of time to meet Maddie’s plane - so while the others waited for its arrival, Laura and I headed off to lost baggage.</p>

<p>Collecting lost baggage requires you to first pass through security - which luckily we had navigated the week prior and were now well prepared for what was ahead. We made it through security quickly and headed for the lost baggage desk - essentially a small makeshift trestle table in the back corner of the arrivals and baggage collection area of the airport.</p>

<p>It appears lost luggage at Rome airport is common - 3 of our group alone lost luggage. While Laura waited in line to be served (by the one person manning the desk), I decided to do a ‘walk-through’ of the mountains of luggage that were setup in makeshift racks and piles surrounding the desk. There would literally be enough ‘lost luggage’ here to fill an entire plane.</p>

<p>Somehow I managed to very quickly stumble across our backpack. Done. After a quick inspection to verify it was ours, the pack was securely on my back and I was off again in search for the pram. Given our experiences at Rome airport to date, I wasn’t overly surprised about the lack of security around the lost luggage. Its surprising really that anything is every returned to its rightful owners under this system (and I hesitate to call it a system).</p>

<p>After some good searching I still could not locate the pram - although there was a mountain of other ‘lost or unclaimed’ prams. For a brief moment, I pondered - should I just grab one and get out of here? I thought better of it. I would hate to be responsible for another family not being able to find their pram - although I really doubt anyone would have stopped me if I had decided to go through with it.</p>

<p>Heading back to Laura (who was still in the queue), I diverted to the bathrooms. It was here I quickly realised what must have been the ultimate downfall of the great Roman empire - water, marble floors and thongs (or sandals back in the day) DO NOT MIX. The simple act of placing a thong bearing foot onto a small puddle of water on highly polished marble tile in the men’s bathrooms resulted in a torrent of blood streaming from my shin as it slammed into the underneath of the sinks.</p>

<p>Being as eco-friendly as they are, Rome airport do not have paper hand towels in the bathrooms, only hand dryers. This left me with a scrap of napkin I was fortunate enough to have left in my pocket to mop up the blood. The napkin was soon soaked, so I headed back to Laura to see if she had something to assist. Another scrap of napkin - however this time it helped to reduce the flow of blood to a trickle… a trickle that in the heat continued for the next hour until I returned to the car - shin still aching.</p>

<p>Maddie’s plane arrived in late, which set our already tight schedule and long drive to Alberobello back further. We eventually hit the road and onto the auto strade - only 5.5hrs to go.</p>

<p>Before we set out we agreed to stop along the way to stretch our legs and for a toilet break - however as we got further and further into the drive I suspect we all just wanted to be there and the thought of stopping was not on anyone’s minds. Eventually we did stop about an hour out of Alberobello - our bladders could not take it any longer and the two drivers (Albert and I) really needed to get out from behind the wheel for a stretch and refresh. Our pit stop lasted about 30min, and we were back on the road again. Our ETA had now pushed out form 8:30pm to just after 9pm… we were going to be arriving in the dark once again. This meant handing full control of navigation over to our TomTom - who at this point we had nicknamed Slip’n Jimmy (a Better Call Saul reference) - because of all the dodgy routes he had taken us on to this point.</p>

<p>Laura decided to call ahead and let the accommodation know we would be arriving late - they were fine with this but told us to call them as we arrived into town as their was a festival on and half of the roads were closed off - this was really going to put Slip’n Jimmy (and the rest of us) to the test.</p>

<p>We were guided into town by the TomTom (Slip’n Jimmy), and to its credit we got a fair way in - but the closed roads were the end of us. It was a little stressful to say the least - in the dark, in a strange town, with no idea of where we were meant to be. Turn left, turn right, or continue on? Did it matter?</p>

<p>We eventually found ourselves parked in front of the main church in town - fortunately out of the way enough to allow all the other traffic to move through without us interrupting them. We called the accommodation again and they walked up to meet us and guided us in.</p>

<p>We eventually made it to our accommodation - some of the UNESCO heritage listed Trulli’s which Alberobello and the region are well known for.</p>

<p>After a long and somewhat stressful drive, we turned in for the night - it was now almost 11pm.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/6f559-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The next morning we all regrouped and headed down to the main town piazza to a restaurant where our breakfast had been arranged. In the light of day the town, and the Trulli houses were amazing - unlike anything we had seen before.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/0a641-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The remainder of the day was spent exploring Alberobello, the various districts of Trullis, the Trulli church, and the largest Trulli in town.<br />
That night the town filled up again and the roads closed - the festival that had stopped us driving into town the night before was still running. We sat on the edge of the main piazza, enjoyed dinner and watched the people flow through.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>On Friday (24th July) we set out early and took a road trip to San Gimignano - about an hour or so away from where we were staying at the villa.</p>

<p>San Gimignano is a medieval hill top fortified city and is renowned for its many towers - everywhere you look there are more.</p>

<p>While San Gimignano is one of the smaller towns we have visited, it is by far one of the more beautiful. The medieval architecture combined with towers in every direction makes for post-card photos everywhere you look.</p>

<p>As you walk through the main city gates, the narrow cobble stone roads lead you up toward the main Piazza. This initial street is lined with shops (for the tourists).</p>

<p>We stopped in a nice little cafe to grab a snack and a coffee before heading into the main piazza. The cafe was full to the brim with beautiful biscotti and chocolates - so we had to sample a few - my favourite was a biscotti covered in pine nuts with a moist almond meal centre.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/1bac2-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/03945-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Continuing our wandering through the main shopping street I recognised a deli that I visited last time I was here (in 2008). Last time I was here I drooled over the look, smell and taste of the local wild boar salami - however, for whatever reason, didn’t buy any…</p>

<p>I didn’t make that mistake twice, and sampled all of the varieties of salami that were on offer before making my purchase of some Salami Cinghiale (wild boar).</p>

<p>After a good wandering through the various shops in San Gimignano, we eventually made it up to the main piazza. From there we continued on walking to the highest point in the city and up onto some of the ancient walls for a spectacular view of both the city and the countryside that surrounds it.</p>

<p>You definitely get a sense for why cites were built on top of the hills in this part of Italy - you can see for miles around - and San Gimignano with its fortifications and many towers would have been well placed to defend itself from any foe.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/5d889-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/fa2ba-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After some more wandering around the ancient city, we started to head back for the car - but not without stopping off at ‘the best gelato’ place in the world. Funnily enough there was another gelato store right across the street that was proclaiming the same thing.</p>

<p>The gelato was nice all the same - lemon and pistachio.</p>

<p>Once we made it back to the cars, our next stop was Siena train station. Today was Rod and Caz’s last day with us before heading back home - and they had to catch their train from Siena.</p>

<p>a short trip from San Gimignano got us into Siena in no time and had Rod and Caz on the train as scheduled.</p>

<p>We headed back home to the villa to spend the rest of the afternoon in the pool - until an afternoon thunderstorm rolled in and bought the rain with it. We didn’t complain though as it also bought the temperature down from about 38c to a much more bearable 25c.</p>

	     <p>So… We have been without Internet access for a few days, and the blog posts have been limited as a result of this. I have a lot to catch up on and as Internet access becomes available - and I have time - new blog posts will begin to show up.</p>

<p>Today (Thursday 23rd July) was a bit of a lay-day - we hung out at the villa and swam to keep cool. After lunch (and siesta) we decided to check out a local winery, <a href="http://www.trecciano.it/it/13/home.aspx">Tenuta di Trecciano</a>, which is about 5km down the road for some tastings.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/7fe0e-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The wine on offer was produced from grape varieties and in the styles typical of the local Tuscan region. We tried 1 white, 4 reds and a desert wine - all rather nice - and we ended up purchasing 4 of their bottles, 1 white and 3 of the red. Interestingly we were encouraged to drink the desert wine by dunking a piece of almond biscotti into it - it made for quite a delicious combination.</p>

<p>The owner took us for a walk through their facility so we could see the wine being bottled.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/31cd5-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After finishing up our tastings we continued on to a local ceramics factory we had found online. It took a bit of finding, but after 3 laps around the block we made it. Most of their ceramic work appeared to be targeted at the bulk commercial market - however they did sell certain pieces direct to the public from their factory.</p>

<p>The owner showed us upstairs to his show room - a small, hot, room full of nicely decorated ceramic plates, cups, bowls, verses, and platters. We all found a few pieces we liked and made our purchases before heading back home.</p>

<p>Once back home we all decided to jump in the pool again to cool off ahead of the Pizza night we had arranged with the owner. The owner and his staff were starting to make preparations - fetching wood for the Pizza oven, making the dough and preparing the ingredients for the toppings.</p>

<p>Watching the Pizza oven in operation was interesting - and extremely hot. The chef worked the oven like a master and put together some of the best pizza we have eaten - delicate thin crust, and extremely tasty toppings.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/fab5c-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/cbaac-image.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>As with the night of the feast a few nights before, we started with a selection of antipasti. This was then followed by a procession of pizzas - one after the other - the continued to come until we could eat no more. We did finish the night with a Nutella pizza and some Limoncello however.</p>

	     <p>Today we jumped in the cars and ventured out to Assisi for a day trip - roughly 120km from where we are staying.</p>

<p>Assisi is the home of many Saints, but probably most prominent was Saint Francis, the founder of the Franciscan order and was named as one of the two patron Saints of Italy (along with Saint Catherine of Siena).</p>

<p>We decided to head out early to try and avoid as much of the heat of the day as we could. The drive to Assisi was reasonably straightforward - at least compared to some of our recent outings and the routes selected by our TomTom.</p>

<p>There was one oddity to the TomTom’s route selection however. After getting us all the way to the outskirts of Assisi via major roads, the TomTom decided it was time to mix things up a little and took us up one of its goat tracks. We were fooled by this one however as at first it looked like a reasonable road, but quickly narrowed to just wider than the 9 seater with no areas to turn around… so we were committed. Thankfully we didn’t meet any traffic coming in the other direction.</p>

<p>The goat track wound us slowly around and up the side of the hill leading to Assisi. We eventually popped out on the side of the main road where we more comfortably continued heading to the top of the hill found a carpark in Piazza Matteotti.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/c4ca2-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>We left the cars and started walking down the hill through the beautiful (but very hot) streets of Assisi. We wandered our way down to the bottom of the hill and ended up at the Basilica of San Francesco d’Assisi.</p>

<p>After touring the Basilica we headed further down the hilly streets of Assisi and found a nice place for lunch - and to escape the head of the day for a while. After lunch we walked through some of the shops at the bottom of the hill (including one that was selling fresh truffles) and grabbed a gelato to help cool off before catching the bus back to the top of the hill and to our cars.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/6b140-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The drive home was fairly uneventful - thankfully and the TomTom got us home on main roads for a change.</p>

	  <title>A Tuscan Feast</title>

	     <p>We arranged with Franco, the owner of the villa, to prepare us a traditional Tuscan feast (an option available to anyone staying at the villa) on Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>We all wanted to celebrate arriving in Tuscany and to mark the start of our holiday, but Tuesday was also Mum’s birthday - and what better excuse to kick back, relax and enjoy some awesome Tuscan food and wine together.</p>

<p>In the early afternoon the chefs and other staff arrived to start preparing the evening meal. The long table on the lawn was set, along with a large accompanying table which would hold all the food for the evening meal.</p>

<p>As the afternoon turned into early evening, we found ourselves heading out onto the lawn to enjoy a few beers in the cooler evening air - waiting in anticipation for the meal to commence.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/a6252-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Before dinner we come together for the obligatory group photo, inclusive of our custom made holiday t-shirts - “Pruscino &amp; Pals - Italian vacanza 2015”.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/5080c-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The feast commenced with an opening toast of Prosseco and a delightful selection of antipasti.</p>

<p>We all sat down and the feast commenced. Following the antipasti dishes were two types of pasta. The first pasta dish was a pappardelle bussola, amd was absolutely amazing, and easily the best pasta dish I have ever eaten. The flavours were amazing, with (what I believe to be) a local mushroom and wild boar ragu.</p>

<p>Following the pasta dishes we had cooked meats, including pork, chicken, sausage as well as roast potatoes, garlic and mixed salads. Needless to say the vino flowed throughout the entire meal.</p>

<p>Desert followed which included both amoretti cake and gelato.</p>

<p>Soon after dinner, given it was Mum’s birthday, we bought out some locally made biscotti, panforte and coffee as well as icy cold Limoncello.</p>

<p>We invited Franco (the owner) and his cooking team down to join us for a few drinks and thanked them for the wonderful feast. Franco bought out some grappa (grappa di pinot), which was passed around for all to enjoy.</p>

<p>Needless to say the evening was extremely enjoyable and went on long into the night - at least until the grappa and vino ran out.</p>

<p>I would really recommend to anyone staying at the <a href="http://www.podereincrociati.it">Podere Incrociati</a> villa to take-up the option of having the Tuscan feast cooked for them - it has been a real highlight.</p>

<p>On Thursday night we have arranged to have a pizza night - so the chefs will be back to cook up a storm on the wood fired pizza oven.</p>

	     <p>So after a long few days of travel, we arrived yesterday evening at what will become our home for the next week - villa <a href="http://www.podereincrociati.it">Podere Incronciati</a> - a traditional Tuscan villa built in 1840 about 20km outside of Siena.</p>

<p>We were welcomed by the owner and offered complimentary wine, cheese, olives, fruit and other nibbles - which was much appreciated after the drive from Rome.</p>

<p>After settling on rooms, we unpacked before hitting the pool to cool down and relax for a bit - which was great in the 38c heat.</p>

<p>Later in the evening we all sat down at a long table outside on the lawn as a group and enjoyed dinner and a few drinks, with a light cooling breeze coming across the field.</p>

<p>We have only been here for a day so far, but we are already totally relaxed - mission accomplished.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>So… The last few day have been hectic and somewhat full-on to say the least.</p>

<p>I was wanting to sit down at the end of each day, with a beer or a glass of wine, and take some time out to update the blog - however given the events of the past few days, this was not possible.</p>

<p>I now find myself sitting in a villa in Tuscany on morning one, a cup of tea and a piece of toast at my side, looking out across an open field towards some bushland, writing about the events leading to this point.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-for-departure">Prepare for Departure</h2>

<p>Early Wednesday evening we find ourselves arriving at Melbourne Airport to catch our flight from Melbourne to Dubai later that night.</p>

<p>At this point spirits are high, although there is some nervousness amongst the traveling group - especially those of us who are travelling with little ones for the first time - however we are well ahead of schedule so nothing can stop us now… Well except maybe a 1.5 hour wait to check in!!</p>

<p>Granted we are not ‘regular’ international travellers, but in the occasional adventures we have never encountered a check-in queue like this one before.</p>

<p>Rapidly we go from being ‘comfortably on-time’ to dancing ridiculously close to the line that results in missing a flight. Needless to say the significantly longer than expected check-in process upped the anxiety levels amongst the travelling group - and we still had to clear customs and get to the gate.</p>

<p>Luckily things flowed somewhat more ‘smoothly’ from that point. We got to the gate with (some) time to spare (they had started calling for us) and promptly took our seats.</p>

<p>The next 14hrs hours of flight is made up of brief naps, resettling our little ones - who were incredibly good throughout the flight - and putting the Wiggles on high repetition on the in-flight entertainment system when the little ones became unsettled.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/560b3-img_0600.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Needless to say we all arrived safely in Dubai just slightly ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>Having come from the ‘Antarctic vortex’ that saw Melbourne temperatures average around 12c, Dubai was defiantly a contrast with its 38c heat.</p>

<h2 id="dubai">Dubai</h2>

<p>Arriving in at Dubai airport, we disembarked the plane and made our way to the arrivals hall - it was here we realised we had forgotten Tiger - Archie’s little teddy bear. We headed back to the plane where the staff were very helpful and assisted us in reuniting Archie with his little Tiger teddy.</p>

<p>This brief interlude had allowed the rest of the passengers to clear customs - meaning a very quick passage through customs ourselves.</p>

<p>A brief (air-conditioned) drive from the airport takes us to our hotel where we settled, had some breakfast and set out to explore the local area. We hired a driver from the hotel who helped to show us around more of Dubai. This was great until our (very tired) son decided he wanted to run to find mum - at which point he tripped on his own feet and face planted into the stone pavers.</p>

<p>A blood nose and a bloody mouth and a lot of tears meant this was the end of our excursions for the afternoon. We were initially fearful Archie may have broken his front teeth - the blood made it very difficult to see what ws actually going on. By the time we arrived back at our hotel, the little guy was laughing and eating again - so we were confident that his teeth were ok.</p>

<p>The swimming pool was the next destination - and a welcome relief from the heat of the Dubai streets.</p>

<p>We all settled in for an early night as we were flying out early in the morning.</p>

<h2 id="dubai-to-rome-via-london">Dubai to Rome via London</h2>

<p>Dubai is where our travelling group split up. Most of our family were travelling with Emerites and were able to fly direct from Dubai to Rome. Unfortunately our ticket required us to transit via London - which was going to make for a very long day.</p>

<p>The flight to London was fairly uneventful, and again Archie was amazing - we were now getting comments from nearby passengers about how good he had been.</p>

<p>London’s Heathrow airport was busy to say the least - and a place I would like to avoid in future with an 18 month old (unfortunately we will be back there before the trip is complete).</p>

<p>4 hours of doing nothing in Heathrow airport is truly about as exciting as it sounds. It makes the long haul plane ride look great in comparison.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/aaee0-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>10 minutes before our boarding gate was to be announced all of the airport departure screens went out. This made for a more lively time - with everyone suddenly rushing the information desks in panic trying to find out what departure gate they needed to get to. We joined in the chaos and eventually found out what our next move was to be - Gate B32.</p>

<p>So off we went, and made it to the gate well ahead of time - given the flight was delayed… more waiting.</p>

<p>We eventually boarded our flight to Rome - with Archie sound asleep on my shoulder… this is where tired little ones in an airport has it advantages - straight to the front of the line and first to board.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/e7d32-img_0603.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="when-in-rome---wait">When in Rome - Wait</h2>

<p>Archie slept the whole flight to Rome, and Laura had a few cat-naps. We arrived into Rome after 11pm. Our plane pulled up to the air bridge and there we waited a further 30min, as the tug had misaligned the plane with the aero-bridge and no one was able to get off - and the tug had to be recalled to realign the plan.</p>

<p>After getting off the plane we cleared passport control easily and headed for the baggage area. Here we waited further. We collected most of our bags, but after further waiting, we soon realised we were not getting all of them. Our pram was missing, and so was a small backpack. Both were more comfort items rather than essential - but their loss was painful none the less. It was well after midnight by this time.</p>

<p>We headed for the lost baggage desk - only to find out that they could not help us and that we needed to speak directly with the airline desk… unfortunate no-one was able to tell us where that was.</p>

<p>So at 12:30am we find ourselves walking through the various terminals of Rome international airport in search of either someone who could help, or the airlines desk. We found neither - and after a very long day of travel and not much sleep we decided to just head for the hotel.</p>

<p>Our hotel was only a short drive from the airport - it should be simple to walk out the front of the airport and hail a cab - at least you would think… After a further 45min of walking between the various cab ranks, we eventually found where we were meant to be - unfortunately there were no cabs around.</p>

<p>At this point it seemed nothing was going our way - including a call to the hotel for assistance. Apparently there is a ‘local law’ that prohibits the hotel from calling some very tired travellers with an 18 month old in tow, a cab at 1am.</p>

<p>Eventually, after some more waiting, a cab did appear and we made it to the hotel. Check-in was simple but at 2am - to discover that we didn’t have a cot in the room (as requested in our booking) was pretty much the not-so-perfect end to a not-so-perfect day.</p>

<p>Grumpy, hot and tired we started to work on settling in for the evening to get some sleep. We stripped Archie off to get him ready to settle in for sleep - turning our back for a minute we hear a barely audible ‘thud’ - turning back around we see Archie has dropped a big poo in the middle of the floor. We looked at each other and all we could do was laugh. In one small action, our 18 month old had littery summed up our day - SHIT.</p>

<p>We cleaned up both Archie and the floor and headed to bed. 4 hours later we were re-united with our travelling group over breakfast.</p>

<p>Venturing out of the hotel a brave few of us headed back to the airport to try and track down our lost baggage. We received an email from the airline overnight indicating the pram had made it to London but thats where it stayed. Our backpack was still in Dubai.</p>

<p>Tracking down the airline lost baggage desk was no easier in the light of day than it was at midnight. We eventually found it and joined the queue at the makeshift trestle table in the back of the arrivals hall.</p>

<p>We decided to split up and start multi-tasking. Laura stayed at the lost property desk while I headed for the rental car office.</p>

<p>I could dedicate a whole blog post to the experience of renting a car at Rome airport. Not an experience I would like to repeat and would recommend against for anyone else travelling to Rome. It can only be described as pure chaos and I will keep it breif.</p>

<p>Getting to the car rental office at around 10:30am, I print a ticket which give me my place in the queue… Number 64 - they were currently serving 32. Not long to wait… like buggery!</p>

<p>I actually struggle to understand how it would even be possible to make the process of renting a car to take so long. People may not believe me if I say I did not leave the rental car office with key in hand until 1pm. It was truly insanity - and I really get the feeling this is ‘normal’.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-to-tuscany">The Road to Tuscany</h2>

<p>Arriving back to the hotel with our rental car, we met up with the rest of our family group and headed off toward Siena.</p>

<p>Driving in Italy for the first time was interesting to say the least - but we adapted pretty quickly, and the drive was actually reasonably straight forward down the auto strata.</p>

<p>We made it into Siena and picked up Mum from the train station. She piled into the other car (a 9 seater mini-van) and we headed out of Siena toward the Villa near Sovicille.</p>

<p>Pulling up at the Villa was exciting - and very picturesque - it was everything we had imagined it would be (pictures coming).</p>

<p>We unpacked and settled in for the evening - a brief swim helped relieve the heat of the afternoon. We dinned outside on a big long table with the family.</p>

<p>Let the holiday begin! Compared to the events of the past few days, the relaxing tranquility of the villa and surrounds is very enjoyable.</p>

	     <p>After almost 18 months of planning, we are now quickly approaching our departure date. Our bags are packed (well mostly), and we are ready to go.</p>

<p>In the past Laura and I have either travelled solo or more typically together as a couple - not this time however…</p>

<p>Since we last had the opportunity to travel abroad, a few things have changed… mainly the arrival of our son (now 18 months old) who will be heading off with us to experience the wonders of the big wide world.</p>

<p>Not only will our son be travelling with us, but a fair part of our immediate families are also joining - some 17 people at last count.</p>

<h2 id="so-where-exactly-are-we-all-headed">So where exactly are we all headed?</h2>

<p>The large (main) group are all set to converge on a villa we have booked in Tuscany - somewhere near Sienna. There we plan to enjoy each others company as we soak in the warmth of the Tuscan sun, and feast on delicious hearty Italian food and wine.</p>

<p>Most of us will also continue on travelling to the south of Italy to arrive in San Lupo - the small town where Laura’s family are originally from.</p>

<p>Following our time in Italy, most of the group will head back home, while we continue on heading into the north of Italy then spending some time in France before heading across to the U.K. where the European leg of our journey will end.</p>

<p>Finally we will head across the pond and spend some time in the U.S. before heading for home.</p>

<p>So so really exciting time ahead of us. The hardest part now is watching the clock slowly tick down to our departure date…</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><img src="/blog//assets/images/sanlupo-poster.jpg" alt="" title="San Lupo - Poster" />
We arrived into Benevento by train from Naples, and were greeted warmly by Laura’s relations Sandra and Lorenzo Ciaglia. We then drove for about 30min up into the hills to our destination, the small town of San Lupo.</p>

<p>We arrived right at the beginning of the three day festa, where the town honors its patron saint - San Lupo.</p>

<p>During the festa the town comes alive, and is dressed up with lights all up and down the main street and through the main piazza in front of the church.</p>

<p>The three days of the festa include various religious and civic events, including various mass’s honoring San Lupo, public concerts of classical music in the piazza, fireworks, processions through the town and the obligatory markets and food stalls.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn’t be an Italian fiesta without food - and there was defiantly no lack of that - Laura and myself generally returned to our accommodation most afternoons(for siesta), and again at night, stuffed to the brim with traditional Italian foods including, various pasta, pepperoni (stuffed peppers), breads, prosciutto, cheeses, parmigiana, vino, and beautiful home made limoncello - to mention just a few.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/san-lupo-village.jpg" alt="" title="San Lupo - Village" />
The town of San Lupo was absolutely beautiful. The main part of the town is essentially a medieval village with tiny cobble stone streets that wind up and down the side of a mountain.</p>

<p>Now days the town sprawls out a little with more modern, free standing houses surrounding the original village - but we were surprised at how modern the interiors of the older houses in the village actually were.</p>

<p>The piazza is the main focal point of the town (as with most European towns and villages) with a church at one end, a bar at the other and houses all around.</p>

<p>The first two nights we stayed about 1km out of town (an easy walk), in a newly opened B&amp;B which was great. On our last night (the festa night) we stayed in town with some family friends, Alex &amp; Berel, who were a lovely older, English speaking, couple.</p>

<p>We participated in most of the events of the festa, including two of the main mass’s, and all three of the town processions - 1 to commemorate the beheading of a bandit who used to raid the town a few centuries ago, the next to bless the local oil and grain, and the final one which was the longest and wound its way through almost every street in the town was to honor San Lupo.</p>

<p><img src="/blog//assets/images/san-lupo-festa1.jpg" alt="" title="San Lupo - Festa" />
The final procession follows immediately after a large mass given by the Bishop. The procession is made up of a marching band at the front, who are followed by many candle holders (who have made offerings to San Lupo). They are followed by another marching band and a group of men who carry the statue of San Lupo on their shoulders. Finally, anyone else who wishes to participate in the procession (this included us) walk behind.</p>

<p>This final procession took about an hour - on quite a warm day - and wound its way through almost every street in San Lupo (all of the main ones at least). It starts and ends at the church.</p>

<p>Many of the candle bearers walk the entire procession in bare feet.</p>

<p>Once the procession has completed (about 2.30pm), everyone retires to their houses for the festa lunch. Sandra had prepared an absolute feast for us - antipasto, lasagna, scallopini, pepperoni, parmigiana, fruit, and cake.</p>

<p>The festa night included continuous music in the piazza from two bands, and ended around 1.30am with a fireworks display - which we were lucky enough to watch from Alex &amp; Beryl’s roof top terrace.</p>

<p>All in all San Lupo was fantastic. Initially we were not sure what to expect - we have passed through some small towns before and had been given a poor impression - San Lupo was unlike any where in Italy we had been before. Everyone knew who we were and that we were Australians (or Kangaroos as we were sometimes referred to) visiting for the festa on our Honeymoon.</p>

<p>San Lupo was defiantly a highlight for Italy, and even our entire trip. It was a fantastic way to spend our last few days in Italy - we will leave with fond memories of this little town, and the people we met there.</p>
