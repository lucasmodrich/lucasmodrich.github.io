	     <p>So it appears they are coming thick and fast…</p>

<p>In my second “Only in America” post, I want to cover what appears to be an emerging “extreme sport” in the local area - The <a href="http://www.krispykremechallenge.com">Krispy Kreme Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is the Krispy Kreme Challenge?  I think they describe the challenge best on their own <a href="http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/ourstory">web site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2400 calories, 12 doughnuts, 5 miles, 1 hour. The mantra of the Krispy Kreme Challenge epitomizes the test of physical fitness and gastrointestinal fortitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The event, which began back in 2004 as a dare between a few NC state university under graduates, has now become an annual event and raises money for the NC Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p>The event basically unfolds as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start out by running 2.5 miles to the local Krispy Kreme store</li>
  <li>Get into Krispy Kreme and eat 12 glazed doughnuts</li>
  <li>Complete the course by running a further 2.5 miles</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I wont be around to participate in this years event.</p>
