	     <p>Last night was our final night in London. Laura and I left Archie with Mum and Jo and then headed out to Soho to find the London Gin Club - something Laura had kindly tracked down for me and thought it would be a great way to spend our last night in London.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/f64df-image.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The club is in an old small pub - pretty casual and unpretentious - which was exactly what we were looking for.</p>

<p>We were greeted at the door and asked if we had a reservation - the place was packed.</p>

<p>“No… Sorry we don’t” we replied.</p>

<p>“Ok - let me see what we can do. Follow me” the waitress said.</p>

<p>We followed down a narrow spiral staircase into the Gin Cellar below and were seated at a small two seater table amongst other Gin drinkers.</p>

<p>The Gin menu was extensive. I settled on one of the tasting boards, while Laura had a Gin cocktail.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/de3aa-image.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The tasting board arrived - 4 vials of selected Gins and accompanying garnishes for each. Two large ice filled glasses then arrived - each Gin deserves its own fresh glass.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/6de7a-image.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The waitress then guided me through the tasting process - first pour the vial of Gin directly over the ice and then taste. Next add some of the premium tonic water that had been provided and taste. Finally add the paired garnish and taste again - then enjoy the rest of the drink. This process was repeated for each of the 4 Gins.</p>

<p>The night went quickly as we both enjoyed sitting in the balmy room down stairs sipping Gin. Later the waitress offered to move us upstairs where it was much cooler - so up we went - and enjoyed more Gin.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/7efb0-image.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/93cea-image.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Given we were flying he next day we wanted to avoid completely writing ourselves off. Not a good idea with an 18 month in tow - so after a few more drinks we called it a night and headed home - very happy with our evening out.</p>

<p>I would really recommend anyone who enjoys the odd Gin to look this place up next time they are in Soho - well worth it.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>So we arrived into London on Thursday afternoon (6th August) from Paris after catching the EuroStar train across the channel.</p>

<p>We were expecting a little more from the EuroStar – the name builds up a certain expectation – and we were left wanting. It probably didn’t help that the air conditioning in our carriage was on the blink either – making for quite a warm journey indeed. Thankfully one of the staff members was extremely helpful and did everything he could to make our journey more comfortable. He initially started handing out bottles of water, but seeing the sweat pumping out of Archie he decided to try and move us. After a little exercise in seat logistics he eventually found us two sets of two seats – we wouldn’t all be sitting together, but at least we would all be a little more comfortable in an better air conditioned carriage. The journey would have been horrible without this – as Archie was really getting quite irritable in the heat.</p>

<p>The train journey from Paris to London was around 2 hours, with barley 20min of that spent in the channel tunnel. Emerging on the English side of the tunnel you immediately notice grey sky… We are definitely in England.</p>

<p>Coming from the dry and often dusty 34-36c daily temperatures of Paris, the lower 25-27c temperatures that were forecast for the next few days in London would be very welcome.</p>

<p>After arriving into our station we discover that there is a tube strike on today – meaning no trains running at all in the Underground. This was going to be interesting. The queue for taxi’s was long, and after getting in one, the roads were quite clogged. Thankfully we got a nice driver who got us to our new home as fast as he could – and 20 Pound later we had arrived.</p>

<p>Our new neighbourhood is a bit rough – I suspect the local riff-raff live directly across the road – and fully expect to be kept up to all hours with dogs barking and kids screaming. People seem to park their cars wherever they want and on whatever side of the road suit them.</p>

<p>I feel like walking across the road to that house and setting a few things straight before we get started – Kensington Palace… who do they think they are…</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/de664-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well so it seems William and Kate are our neighbours – literally a misguided drop-punt would have your footy over their fence – I suspect Will would be a pretty good sport and kick it back however.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/ee14b-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So it appears we are not in a scrubby neighbourhood at all, but rather the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea – the X-Trail would look rather ‘out-of-place’ here I can tell you. Most car bonnets seem to be emblazon with either a three-point-star, four joined hoops, a horse, a big B or R. I think you get my drift – not to many Toyota’s or Nissan’s.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/97d0f-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the cars are pitch black, with drivers at the ready. Our street (Prince of Wales Terrace) seems to be some sort of a waiting bay – drivers come and sit in their expensive luxury cars, some get out and polish the duco back to an immaculate shine – all waiting for whoever they work for to call.</p>

<p>Anyway, Will and Kate have been pretty good neighbours so far – not a peep – I’m not even sure if they are at home. I was hoping Will might sneak across the road for a quite pint at the end of the day (once the kids are in bed) – but we haven’t seen him in the Goat (our closest pub).</p>

<p>On the last two evenings we have enjoyed having a picnic dinner in Kensington Gardens, right at the back of the Palace – Archie has become quite fond of the ducks at the big pond.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/0466a-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday (Friday), Laura, Jo, Archie and I all jumped on a regional train and headed for Bath. Mum had been there recently so she did her own thing in and around London for the day.</p>

<p>The trip up to Bath took around 2hrs, but the journey was well worth the wait – Bath is beautiful… and I think next time we might have to stay there for a few days.</p>

<p>Big old streets, white sandstone buildings, big blossoming gardens and all immaculately clean. We spent the whole day wandering around Bath – there is just so much to take in.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/47615-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Laura and Jo went to the Jane Austin house, while Archie and I went to check out the smallest pub in Bath and have a local pint. Small was right – no room to swing a cat, let along a pram. The pram got folded up and Archie and I sat on the remaining 2-seater table next to the bar (there were only 4 in total inside).</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/0e2bc-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After our (my) pint of local ale, we headed back to meet up with the girls and headed down to the river for some lunch.</p>

<p>We continued to drift around Bath for the remainder of the day before catching the train back to London in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>Today we set out reasonably early and caught the train to the Tower of London. Getting there early was a great plan – there was no queue and we went straight in. Laura and I missed the Tower of London last time we were here (2008), so had it on the list to see this time round. We spend a good hour or so wandering around the grounds, and Archie seemed to enjoy himself – entertaining the Beefeaters.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/3aee6-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Laura, Archie and I left Jo and Mum at the tower (not literally) – they had booked a show in the afternoon and we wanted to see a few more sights before heading home to get Archie off to bed for the afternoon.</p>

<p>We caught the train up to Westminster – Saturdays in London in summer are full on. Tourists everywhere. Coming out of Westminster station we could hardly move. I think it took as about 25 min to get from the station, across the road to see Big Ben, across to Westminster itself before heading back toward St. James Garden – it was packed.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/d4841-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The walk up through St. James garden was beautiful, and London turned on an incredible day for us to be out walking. We wandered up through the gardens to Buckingham Palace then continued on to Hyde Park Corner before diverting off to see Harrods.</p>

<p>After a walk through Harrods, and some lunch, we headed back to the train station and home.</p>

<p>We are not waiting for Jo and Mum to get home from their show so we can ‘change the guards’ and leave Archie with Mum and Jo for the evening while Laura and I head out for dinner and a few drinks – Soho is the plan… but we will see what eventuates.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we fly to New York!</p>

	     <p>So… The last few day have been hectic and somewhat full-on to say the least.</p>

<p>I was wanting to sit down at the end of each day, with a beer or a glass of wine, and take some time out to update the blog - however given the events of the past few days, this was not possible.</p>

<p>I now find myself sitting in a villa in Tuscany on morning one, a cup of tea and a piece of toast at my side, looking out across an open field towards some bushland, writing about the events leading to this point.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-for-departure">Prepare for Departure</h2>

<p>Early Wednesday evening we find ourselves arriving at Melbourne Airport to catch our flight from Melbourne to Dubai later that night.</p>

<p>At this point spirits are high, although there is some nervousness amongst the traveling group - especially those of us who are travelling with little ones for the first time - however we are well ahead of schedule so nothing can stop us now… Well except maybe a 1.5 hour wait to check in!!</p>

<p>Granted we are not ‘regular’ international travellers, but in the occasional adventures we have never encountered a check-in queue like this one before.</p>

<p>Rapidly we go from being ‘comfortably on-time’ to dancing ridiculously close to the line that results in missing a flight. Needless to say the significantly longer than expected check-in process upped the anxiety levels amongst the travelling group - and we still had to clear customs and get to the gate.</p>

<p>Luckily things flowed somewhat more ‘smoothly’ from that point. We got to the gate with (some) time to spare (they had started calling for us) and promptly took our seats.</p>

<p>The next 14hrs hours of flight is made up of brief naps, resettling our little ones - who were incredibly good throughout the flight - and putting the Wiggles on high repetition on the in-flight entertainment system when the little ones became unsettled.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/560b3-img_0600.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Needless to say we all arrived safely in Dubai just slightly ahead of schedule.</p>

<p>Having come from the ‘Antarctic vortex’ that saw Melbourne temperatures average around 12c, Dubai was defiantly a contrast with its 38c heat.</p>

<h2 id="dubai">Dubai</h2>

<p>Arriving in at Dubai airport, we disembarked the plane and made our way to the arrivals hall - it was here we realised we had forgotten Tiger - Archie’s little teddy bear. We headed back to the plane where the staff were very helpful and assisted us in reuniting Archie with his little Tiger teddy.</p>

<p>This brief interlude had allowed the rest of the passengers to clear customs - meaning a very quick passage through customs ourselves.</p>

<p>A brief (air-conditioned) drive from the airport takes us to our hotel where we settled, had some breakfast and set out to explore the local area. We hired a driver from the hotel who helped to show us around more of Dubai. This was great until our (very tired) son decided he wanted to run to find mum - at which point he tripped on his own feet and face planted into the stone pavers.</p>

<p>A blood nose and a bloody mouth and a lot of tears meant this was the end of our excursions for the afternoon. We were initially fearful Archie may have broken his front teeth - the blood made it very difficult to see what ws actually going on. By the time we arrived back at our hotel, the little guy was laughing and eating again - so we were confident that his teeth were ok.</p>

<p>The swimming pool was the next destination - and a welcome relief from the heat of the Dubai streets.</p>

<p>We all settled in for an early night as we were flying out early in the morning.</p>

<h2 id="dubai-to-rome-via-london">Dubai to Rome via London</h2>

<p>Dubai is where our travelling group split up. Most of our family were travelling with Emerites and were able to fly direct from Dubai to Rome. Unfortunately our ticket required us to transit via London - which was going to make for a very long day.</p>

<p>The flight to London was fairly uneventful, and again Archie was amazing - we were now getting comments from nearby passengers about how good he had been.</p>

<p>London’s Heathrow airport was busy to say the least - and a place I would like to avoid in future with an 18 month old (unfortunately we will be back there before the trip is complete).</p>

<p>4 hours of doing nothing in Heathrow airport is truly about as exciting as it sounds. It makes the long haul plane ride look great in comparison.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/aaee0-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>10 minutes before our boarding gate was to be announced all of the airport departure screens went out. This made for a more lively time - with everyone suddenly rushing the information desks in panic trying to find out what departure gate they needed to get to. We joined in the chaos and eventually found out what our next move was to be - Gate B32.</p>

<p>So off we went, and made it to the gate well ahead of time - given the flight was delayed… more waiting.</p>

<p>We eventually boarded our flight to Rome - with Archie sound asleep on my shoulder… this is where tired little ones in an airport has it advantages - straight to the front of the line and first to board.</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/e7d32-img_0603.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="when-in-rome---wait">When in Rome - Wait</h2>

<p>Archie slept the whole flight to Rome, and Laura had a few cat-naps. We arrived into Rome after 11pm. Our plane pulled up to the air bridge and there we waited a further 30min, as the tug had misaligned the plane with the aero-bridge and no one was able to get off - and the tug had to be recalled to realign the plan.</p>

<p>After getting off the plane we cleared passport control easily and headed for the baggage area. Here we waited further. We collected most of our bags, but after further waiting, we soon realised we were not getting all of them. Our pram was missing, and so was a small backpack. Both were more comfort items rather than essential - but their loss was painful none the less. It was well after midnight by this time.</p>

<p>We headed for the lost baggage desk - only to find out that they could not help us and that we needed to speak directly with the airline desk… unfortunate no-one was able to tell us where that was.</p>

<p>So at 12:30am we find ourselves walking through the various terminals of Rome international airport in search of either someone who could help, or the airlines desk. We found neither - and after a very long day of travel and not much sleep we decided to just head for the hotel.</p>

<p>Our hotel was only a short drive from the airport - it should be simple to walk out the front of the airport and hail a cab - at least you would think… After a further 45min of walking between the various cab ranks, we eventually found where we were meant to be - unfortunately there were no cabs around.</p>

<p>At this point it seemed nothing was going our way - including a call to the hotel for assistance. Apparently there is a ‘local law’ that prohibits the hotel from calling some very tired travellers with an 18 month old in tow, a cab at 1am.</p>

<p>Eventually, after some more waiting, a cab did appear and we made it to the hotel. Check-in was simple but at 2am - to discover that we didn’t have a cot in the room (as requested in our booking) was pretty much the not-so-perfect end to a not-so-perfect day.</p>

<p>Grumpy, hot and tired we started to work on settling in for the evening to get some sleep. We stripped Archie off to get him ready to settle in for sleep - turning our back for a minute we hear a barely audible ‘thud’ - turning back around we see Archie has dropped a big poo in the middle of the floor. We looked at each other and all we could do was laugh. In one small action, our 18 month old had littery summed up our day - SHIT.</p>

<p>We cleaned up both Archie and the floor and headed to bed. 4 hours later we were re-united with our travelling group over breakfast.</p>

<p>Venturing out of the hotel a brave few of us headed back to the airport to try and track down our lost baggage. We received an email from the airline overnight indicating the pram had made it to London but thats where it stayed. Our backpack was still in Dubai.</p>

<p>Tracking down the airline lost baggage desk was no easier in the light of day than it was at midnight. We eventually found it and joined the queue at the makeshift trestle table in the back of the arrivals hall.</p>

<p>We decided to split up and start multi-tasking. Laura stayed at the lost property desk while I headed for the rental car office.</p>

<p>I could dedicate a whole blog post to the experience of renting a car at Rome airport. Not an experience I would like to repeat and would recommend against for anyone else travelling to Rome. It can only be described as pure chaos and I will keep it breif.</p>

<p>Getting to the car rental office at around 10:30am, I print a ticket which give me my place in the queue… Number 64 - they were currently serving 32. Not long to wait… like buggery!</p>

<p>I actually struggle to understand how it would even be possible to make the process of renting a car to take so long. People may not believe me if I say I did not leave the rental car office with key in hand until 1pm. It was truly insanity - and I really get the feeling this is ‘normal’.</p>

<h2 id="the-road-to-tuscany">The Road to Tuscany</h2>

<p>Arriving back to the hotel with our rental car, we met up with the rest of our family group and headed off toward Siena.</p>

<p>Driving in Italy for the first time was interesting to say the least - but we adapted pretty quickly, and the drive was actually reasonably straight forward down the auto strata.</p>

<p>We made it into Siena and picked up Mum from the train station. She piled into the other car (a 9 seater mini-van) and we headed out of Siena toward the Villa near Sovicille.</p>

<p>Pulling up at the Villa was exciting - and very picturesque - it was everything we had imagined it would be (pictures coming).</p>

<p>We unpacked and settled in for the evening - a brief swim helped relieve the heat of the afternoon. We dinned outside on a big long table with the family.</p>

<p>Let the holiday begin! Compared to the events of the past few days, the relaxing tranquility of the villa and surrounds is very enjoyable.</p>

	     <p>Let me start by saying - This place is ace!</p>

<p>We landed into Gatwick from Naples, almost a 3 hour flight, and had to make our way to Heathrow Terminal 4 - which nothing seems to go to directly!</p>

<p>We converted our left over Euro’s into Pounds which was almost exactly enough to buy our bus ticket from Gatwick to Heathrow - luckily its a free ride for BA travellers from Terminal 5 to Terminal 4 on the bus.</p>

<p>We got here in reasonable time, and cleared security reasonably quickly. On the other side I suggested to Laura that we ‘try’ our Qantas Frequent Flyer card at the BA Lounge - we could only be turned away and have to sit in the public lounge for just over 2 hours.</p>

<p>Laura was a little hesitant initially, and took some convincing. I was not even sure we would get in. We approached the entry desk, presented our cards and boarding passes and we let in immediately!</p>

<p>We walked in and we were a little overwhelmed - what to do first? Use the free internet, go to the serve yourself anything you can dream of bar, the cafe, use the showers… All of it is free!</p>

<p>First up we grabbed some food - if we hadn’t been allowed in we were looking at a £10 McDonald’s meal. We enjoyed dinner with a lovely 2001 red wine, followed by a tall Gin &amp; Tonic. We then had some more salad and bread, and finished with cheese and crackers.</p>

<p>After a few more free pour Gin &amp; Tonics we decided to have a shower - it was rather hot in Italy, and we have an 11 hour trip ahead of us. We were given our beeper to be alerted when the private shower facilities were free - this gave us time for another Gin &amp; Tonic (for me) and a Bailies on ice (for Laura).</p>

<p>After showering and freshening up we went to the lower level to use the internet - where I am now. Laura indulged in another glass of fine red wine, and I helped my self to a few more Gin &amp; Tonics.</p>

<p>Let me assure you - this place is much better than McDonald’s - but I’m sure we have already paid for it all (and more) in our ticket prices somewhere along the line. It’s just a pity we only discovered it now. Let me assure you we will be checking in early in Bangkok!</p>

<p>Anyway, must away… My Gin &amp; Tonic is empty.</p>

<p>See you all soon.</p>

	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p><strong>London - Our initial taste</strong></p>

<p>While we were briefly in London before departing to Ireland for a week, we managed to squeeze in some sight seeing - jumping on a ‘Fat Tire’ bike tour. This was a leisurely 4 hour bike ride around central London, and was a great way of getting oriented.</p>

<p>While we didn’t go into any of the sights on the tour, we were given a pretty good commentary on each sight and its history. This gave us a pretty good idea of what we should come back and see.</p>

<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>

<p>After our time in Ireland, we jumped on a flight out of Dublin to Liverpool - the 2008 European city of culture!</p>

<p>We were flat out in Liverpool - landing at about 8am, and a bus booked back to London at 5pm, we had to squeeze as much out of our time there as possible.</p>

<p>Initially we dumped out bags at the train station - no point carting an extra 20kg each!</p>

<p>We then wandered down to the Albert Dock, with the intention of arriving to our ‘Magical Mystery’ Beatles tour just before 12.</p>

<p>Having some time to fill we went through the free Slavery Museum at the Albert Docks Maritime Museum. This was pretty interesting, and illustrated how involved Liverpool was in the slave trade (it was basically the centrer of the slavery business in Europe).</p>

<p>We then jumped onto the Beatles tour which took us through the city and suburbs of Liverpool - taking us to some of the most significant Beatles locations, including George, John, Paul, and Ringo’s childhood houses, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and the Cavern Club.</p>

<p>After the tour, we had a quick beer at the Cavern Club, before heading back down towards the docks to jump on a ferry cruise across the Mersey.</p>

<p>So that was about all we could manage to squeeze out of Liverpool in our time there. We jumped on the bus, literally minutes after it began to rain (our timing with weather has been great).</p>

<p>The bus ride was pretty boring - all 5 hours of it, but we made it back to London city by about 11.30pm, enough time to jump on the Tube and get back out to Fulham where we were staying with friends.</p>

<p><strong>Back in London</strong></p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/london-harrods.jpg" alt="" title="London - Harrods" />
Back in London we set out to see all the sights we had toured passed on our bike tour.</p>

<p>The day was pretty full on - we managed to see Harrod’s, West Minster Abby, Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and Tower Bridge, London Bridge (which is actually very boring and plain!), then we finished the day by getting back to West Minster for the Evening Song Choral service - this was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The sound of the choir in the Abby was fantastic (although the big draw card for us was that by going to the service, you get into the Abby for free - saving about 14 pounds each).</p>

<p><img src="//assets/images/london-changing-of-the-guard.jpg" alt="" title="London - Changing of the guard" />
Some where along the line (can’t remember where now?), we also managed to see the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace. This was defiantly something worth seeing - and as usual, we took a ton of pictures.</p>

<p>In the Abby, we managed to see the tombs of Sir Issac Newton, Charles Darwin, and Winston Churchill - pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The following day we headed up to Greenwich - which was a spectacular 25c day. If we had realised how good it was in Greenwich, we would have made sure we spent some time in a beer garden there, but we had already arranged to meet friends in the city.</p>

<p>We grabbed one of the ferries up the Thames to Greenwich - this is great for nice views of Big Ben, the Tower of London, and the Tower Bridge.</p>

<p>In Greenwich we did a walking tour which took us through the Naval buildings, and explained much of the history of the area. We ended up at the Observatory - the location of the Prime Meridian, and where world time is measured from.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, we headed into the city to catch up with a few old mates who had moved over from Australia.</p>

<p>We had big plans for our last day in London - we wanted to head to Bath and Stonehenge, but unfortunately we left some of the planning to the last minute and this didn’t end up occurring. This gave us th opportunity to head back into London and do some of the sights we hadn’t got to yet.</p>

<p>We visited the Winston Churchill War Cabinet, and Museum which was fantastic. We then headed to Notting Hill, and down Portabello Road - although being a week day the markets were not overly active.</p>

<p>From here we headed into Oxford and Regent streets - having lunch in a pub in Soho.</p>

<p>Following this we headed to Lester Square and located the nearby Her Majesty’s Theater to catch the ‘Phantom of the Opera’ - which was a great show.</p>

<p>This basically wraps up our time in London - we made sure that we left some things to do next time we come back!</p>

<p>Will try to get some of our London pictures up shortly.</p>

	     <p>We have now left the Spanish speaking countries behind us after about 7 weeks of traveling. We find it hard to stop saying ‘Gracias’ to people - but I’m sure we will get over it.</p>

<p>Our flight out of Barcelona was delayed by about 30min, but we managed to touch down on British soil fine. We were dreading hitting Heathrow a little - you never seem to hear a good story about that place - but we were very surprised when we only queued for about 5min in immigration and waled straight through customs. Literally took us about 10min! We spent longer in the duty free grog shop buying gifts for our hosts here in London.</p>

<p>We caught the train from the airport to Paddington station, where we dumped our bags and started walking.</p>

<p>The very first thing that hit us ws the smell of fried food - the train station was full of it. I was an unfortunately familiar smell - one that we haven’t come across for the last 7 weeks.</p>

<p>We had no idea where we were and where things were in relation to us (no, we hadn’t done our homework again!). Wandering the streets we stumbled on a sign pointing to Hyde Park - where we managed to spend th rest of the afternoon.</p>

<p>We found our way back to Paddington station (and saw Princess Ann getting into a huge Bentley), grabbed our packs (and quickly remembered how heavy they were), and caught th train to Elouise’s place in Fulham - a reasonably easy experience.</p>

<p>Last night we ducked down to the local for a few pints and some dinner - its funny how comforting it was to have dinner in an English pub. Reminded us of home - at least the closest we have come so far.</p>

<p>This morning we were pleasantly surprised to have a Skype call with Laura’s parents - it was great to chat and touch base at home again.</p>

<p>Today we are planing to head into London and try to pick up a bike tour - which should be great providing the rain holds off!</p>
