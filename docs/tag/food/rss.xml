We arrived in Bologna yesterday afternoon, after a short train trip from Venice (2 hours). We managed to navigate the local bus system with the help of a local and shortly after arrived at our B&amp;B which is located in the country side hills overlooking farmland and the city - about 15 minutes drive out of town.</p>

<p>Its absolutely beautiful here. The relaxing surroundings, the peacefulness of the Italian country side… Its just what we needed - a change from staying in city’s.</p>

<p>After a relaxed afternoon of sitting on our balcony overlooking the country side, and having a few refreshing beers… and a nap… it was time for dinner out on the patio where we could watch the sun setting over Bologna.</p>

We selected the local traditional plater and a salad to share for dinner, which was made up of all local produce including; salami, prosciutto, mortadela (which originated here in Bologna), dips and sauces, pickled peppers, pickled onions, pork fat, parmesan, and two types of bread - one a fried flat bread, and the other a small hard bread (resembling a hard flat scone). Our meal was accompanied by a glass or two of wine, and some conversation with the owner.</p>

It really topped of a very relaxing afternoon - it was beautiful sitting outside, eating dinner, watching the sun go down.</p>

<p>Today we have plans to catch the bus into town and look around. Bologna - what we saw briefly of it yesterday - appears to be a lovely city with lots to see, and it has a reputation for amazing local food (Parma - where Parma ham is from, and Modena - where the fine Balsamic is from, are both just up the road).</p>
