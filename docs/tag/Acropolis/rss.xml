We got into Athens yesterday afternoon - great weather, we managed to escape the bad weather that has been forecast for the UK!</p>

<p>Yesterday basically involved getting from the airport to the hotel and checking in.</p>

<p>Today we decided to take an easy day - we have been on the go for so long you just need to recharge the batteries every now and then.</p>

<p>So a slow day involved heading into the Acropolis and seeing a number of the other sites that surround it. We then had a bite of lunch at a local cafe before heading back to the hotel for the afternoon - where we hav spent hours attempting to plan how to get from Finland to Germany without it costing a fortune. Unfortunately this is just not possible, so we booked the first flight out (which was the cheapest by far, but still relatively expensive :( ).</p>

<p>We have booked onto a 3 island tour for tomorrow - so this will be a long day, but we are looking forward to getting out and seeing some of the islands.</p>
