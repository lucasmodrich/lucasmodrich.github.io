	     <p>So to day was Fathers Day.</p>

<p>Apparently I qualify in the “soon to be category” (lets call it almost fathers day) and was able to bask in the moment for a while..</p>

<p>While we didn’t do anything quite as exciting as visiting Tropical Fruit world today we did hit Bris-Vagas…</p>

<p>Couldn’t have been a better day. The weather was perfectly warm. Roaming the south bank region of Brisy is amazing on days like this - even more so when you find a bar with Matilda Bay beer dominating the taps of the week - and pints for $8.50.</p>

<p>After spending most of our day in the south bank region of Brisy, we headed back to the shelter and serenity of Kingscliff.</p>

<p>An afternoon walk on the beach, a few quiet bevies if the suite while coming up to speed on Breaking Bad (apparently we are the only people on this rock not to have seen it yet!), and I now find myself sipping an Asahi while waiting for my take-away Thai order - what better way to finish my “Almost Father’s Day”.</p>

<p>So it’s back home tomorrow.. Reality always catches up with you at some point. Apparently Melbourne has been having some brilliant weather while we have been away. Spring is here and summer is not far away.</p>

<p>Sorry to think that this will likely be our last trip away for a few years. Time to focus on family!</p>

	     <p>So it’s a Sunday afternoon in Raleigh, North Carolina. I find myself downtown with not much to do - as most places are closed.</p>

<p>On a cool afternoon, I now find myself at <a href="http://www.beerknurd.com">The Flying Saucer</a> - possibly the best bar I have been to in the Northern Hemisphere (and defiantly the US!)</p>

<p>With over 200 beers available, made up from both local brew craft and imported, where else should I be for a belated solo Australian day party? These guys know how to do beer. Every option is covered - even direct from the cask.</p>

<p>Further the daily “fire sale” which is on local beers today, means I can sample the local drop (which is quite handy to be honest) at $3 a pint!!</p>

<p>To be honest, I never have the yanks credit for any beer I had ever tasted - up until now! They can brew it like the best when it comes to local brew craft style beers. Pity none of these make out shores back in Australia.</p>

<p>Today I have eventually settled on a beer from the New Belgium beer company called “Fat Tire”. It’s an Amber Ale (from Fort Collins, CO) and defiantly delivers.</p>

<p>My “runner-up” for today is one if the locals (from Raleigh, NC) - a wheat beer by Lonerider called “Shotgun Betty”. This was a classic wheat beer with a nice banana follow thru.</p>

<p>To be honest, I would quite happily sit on either of these beers all arvo. But with limited time and variety and experimentation the key I have ended up tasting a wide range of brews from across the US. These two I mention though are the finishers for the afternoon and will happily see me home tonight.</p>

<p>You can join up to the UFO club at the bar also. Members who manage to drink their way to 200 beers are immortalised on a flying saucer on the roof or wall of the bar. The putter ring of the saucer indicating how many times you have reached the 200 brew milestone.</p>

<p>Unfortunately with my short time here I doubt I will come close to qualifying for my own saucer.</p>

<p>Given I was in transit for 26 hours yesterday, I have declared today to be my own personal and informal Australia Day. And I find the Flying Saucer a most enjoyable place to celebrate the day.</p>
