	     <p>So it appears they are coming thick and fast…</p>

<p>In my second “Only in America” post, I want to cover what appears to be an emerging “extreme sport” in the local area - The <a href="http://www.krispykremechallenge.com">Krispy Kreme Challenge</a>.</p>

<p>So, what exactly is the Krispy Kreme Challenge?  I think they describe the challenge best on their own <a href="http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/ourstory">web site</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2400 calories, 12 doughnuts, 5 miles, 1 hour. The mantra of the Krispy Kreme Challenge epitomizes the test of physical fitness and gastrointestinal fortitude.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The event, which began back in 2004 as a dare between a few NC state university under graduates, has now become an annual event and raises money for the NC Children’s Hospital.</p>

<p>The event basically unfolds as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Start out by running 2.5 miles to the local Krispy Kreme store</li>
  <li>Get into Krispy Kreme and eat 12 glazed doughnuts</li>
  <li>Complete the course by running a further 2.5 miles</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I wont be around to participate in this years event.</p>

	     <p>To kick off my “Only in America” series of posts (I am assuming there will be more than one), I bring to you some pictures of a locally “pimped ride” I came across in the car park of a local mall on my morning walk.<br />

<p>I can only assume, that, much like the unique creatures that evolve in places such as Easter Island, this vehicle has similarly been forced to evolve and adapt to survive in local conditions.  I believe this one is particularly adapted to the snowy and icy conditions that are being experienced in the local area.</p>
