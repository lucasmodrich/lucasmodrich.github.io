	  <description><![CDATA[
	     <p>So we arrived into London on Thursday afternoon (6th August) from Paris after catching the EuroStar train across the channel.</p>

<p>We were expecting a little more from the EuroStar – the name builds up a certain expectation – and we were left wanting. It probably didn’t help that the air conditioning in our carriage was on the blink either – making for quite a warm journey indeed. Thankfully one of the staff members was extremely helpful and did everything he could to make our journey more comfortable. He initially started handing out bottles of water, but seeing the sweat pumping out of Archie he decided to try and move us. After a little exercise in seat logistics he eventually found us two sets of two seats – we wouldn’t all be sitting together, but at least we would all be a little more comfortable in an better air conditioned carriage. The journey would have been horrible without this – as Archie was really getting quite irritable in the heat.</p>

<p>The train journey from Paris to London was around 2 hours, with barley 20min of that spent in the channel tunnel. Emerging on the English side of the tunnel you immediately notice grey sky… We are definitely in England.</p>

<p>Coming from the dry and often dusty 34-36c daily temperatures of Paris, the lower 25-27c temperatures that were forecast for the next few days in London would be very welcome.</p>

<p>After arriving into our station we discover that there is a tube strike on today – meaning no trains running at all in the Underground. This was going to be interesting. The queue for taxi’s was long, and after getting in one, the roads were quite clogged. Thankfully we got a nice driver who got us to our new home as fast as he could – and 20 Pound later we had arrived.</p>

<p>Our new neighbourhood is a bit rough – I suspect the local riff-raff live directly across the road – and fully expect to be kept up to all hours with dogs barking and kids screaming. People seem to park their cars wherever they want and on whatever side of the road suit them.</p>

<p>I feel like walking across the road to that house and setting a few things straight before we get started – Kensington Palace… who do they think they are…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/de664-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Well so it seems William and Kate are our neighbours – literally a misguided drop-punt would have your footy over their fence – I suspect Will would be a pretty good sport and kick it back however.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/ee14b-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>So it appears we are not in a scrubby neighbourhood at all, but rather the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea – the X-Trail would look rather ‘out-of-place’ here I can tell you. Most car bonnets seem to be emblazon with either a three-point-star, four joined hoops, a horse, a big B or R. I think you get my drift – not to many Toyota’s or Nissan’s.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/97d0f-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Most of the cars are pitch black, with drivers at the ready. Our street (Prince of Wales Terrace) seems to be some sort of a waiting bay – drivers come and sit in their expensive luxury cars, some get out and polish the duco back to an immaculate shine – all waiting for whoever they work for to call.</p>

<p>Anyway, Will and Kate have been pretty good neighbours so far – not a peep – I’m not even sure if they are at home. I was hoping Will might sneak across the road for a quite pint at the end of the day (once the kids are in bed) – but we haven’t seen him in the Goat (our closest pub).</p>

<p>On the last two evenings we have enjoyed having a picnic dinner in Kensington Gardens, right at the back of the Palace – Archie has become quite fond of the ducks at the big pond.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0466a-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Yesterday (Friday), Laura, Jo, Archie and I all jumped on a regional train and headed for Bath. Mum had been there recently so she did her own thing in and around London for the day.</p>

<p>The trip up to Bath took around 2hrs, but the journey was well worth the wait – Bath is beautiful… and I think next time we might have to stay there for a few days.</p>

<p>Big old streets, white sandstone buildings, big blossoming gardens and all immaculately clean. We spent the whole day wandering around Bath – there is just so much to take in.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/47615-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Laura and Jo went to the Jane Austin house, while Archie and I went to check out the smallest pub in Bath and have a local pint. Small was right – no room to swing a cat, let along a pram. The pram got folded up and Archie and I sat on the remaining 2-seater table next to the bar (there were only 4 in total inside).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/0e2bc-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>After our (my) pint of local ale, we headed back to meet up with the girls and headed down to the river for some lunch.</p>

<p>We continued to drift around Bath for the remainder of the day before catching the train back to London in the late afternoon.</p>

<p>Today we set out reasonably early and caught the train to the Tower of London. Getting there early was a great plan – there was no queue and we went straight in. Laura and I missed the Tower of London last time we were here (2008), so had it on the list to see this time round. We spend a good hour or so wandering around the grounds, and Archie seemed to enjoy himself – entertaining the Beefeaters.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/3aee6-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Laura, Archie and I left Jo and Mum at the tower (not literally) – they had booked a show in the afternoon and we wanted to see a few more sights before heading home to get Archie off to bed for the afternoon.</p>

<p>We caught the train up to Westminster – Saturdays in London in summer are full on. Tourists everywhere. Coming out of Westminster station we could hardly move. I think it took as about 25 min to get from the station, across the road to see Big Ben, across to Westminster itself before heading back toward St. James Garden – it was packed.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/d4841-img.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The walk up through St. James garden was beautiful, and London turned on an incredible day for us to be out walking. We wandered up through the gardens to Buckingham Palace then continued on to Hyde Park Corner before diverting off to see Harrods.</p>

<p>After a walk through Harrods, and some lunch, we headed back to the train station and home.</p>

<p>We are not waiting for Jo and Mum to get home from their show so we can ‘change the guards’ and leave Archie with Mum and Jo for the evening while Laura and I head out for dinner and a few drinks – Soho is the plan… but we will see what eventuates.</p>

<p>Tomorrow we fly to New York!</p>

	     <p><strong>London - Our initial taste</strong></p>

<p>While we were briefly in London before departing to Ireland for a week, we managed to squeeze in some sight seeing - jumping on a ‘Fat Tire’ bike tour. This was a leisurely 4 hour bike ride around central London, and was a great way of getting oriented.</p>

<p>While we didn’t go into any of the sights on the tour, we were given a pretty good commentary on each sight and its history. This gave us a pretty good idea of what we should come back and see.</p>

<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>

<p>After our time in Ireland, we jumped on a flight out of Dublin to Liverpool - the 2008 European city of culture!</p>

<p>We were flat out in Liverpool - landing at about 8am, and a bus booked back to London at 5pm, we had to squeeze as much out of our time there as possible.</p>

<p>Initially we dumped out bags at the train station - no point carting an extra 20kg each!</p>

<p>We then wandered down to the Albert Dock, with the intention of arriving to our ‘Magical Mystery’ Beatles tour just before 12.</p>

<p>Having some time to fill we went through the free Slavery Museum at the Albert Docks Maritime Museum. This was pretty interesting, and illustrated how involved Liverpool was in the slave trade (it was basically the centrer of the slavery business in Europe).</p>

<p>We then jumped onto the Beatles tour which took us through the city and suburbs of Liverpool - taking us to some of the most significant Beatles locations, including George, John, Paul, and Ringo’s childhood houses, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and the Cavern Club.</p>

<p>After the tour, we had a quick beer at the Cavern Club, before heading back down towards the docks to jump on a ferry cruise across the Mersey.</p>

<p>So that was about all we could manage to squeeze out of Liverpool in our time there. We jumped on the bus, literally minutes after it began to rain (our timing with weather has been great).</p>

<p>The bus ride was pretty boring - all 5 hours of it, but we made it back to London city by about 11.30pm, enough time to jump on the Tube and get back out to Fulham where we were staying with friends.</p>

<p><strong>Back in London</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/london-harrods.jpg" alt="" title="London - Harrods" />
Back in London we set out to see all the sights we had toured passed on our bike tour.</p>

<p>The day was pretty full on - we managed to see Harrod’s, West Minster Abby, Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Tower of London, and Tower Bridge, London Bridge (which is actually very boring and plain!), then we finished the day by getting back to West Minster for the Evening Song Choral service - this was pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The sound of the choir in the Abby was fantastic (although the big draw card for us was that by going to the service, you get into the Abby for free - saving about 14 pounds each).</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/london-changing-of-the-guard.jpg" alt="" title="London - Changing of the guard" />
Some where along the line (can’t remember where now?), we also managed to see the changing of the guards at Buckingham Palace. This was defiantly something worth seeing - and as usual, we took a ton of pictures.</p>

<p>In the Abby, we managed to see the tombs of Sir Issac Newton, Charles Darwin, and Winston Churchill - pretty awesome.</p>

<p>The following day we headed up to Greenwich - which was a spectacular 25c day. If we had realised how good it was in Greenwich, we would have made sure we spent some time in a beer garden there, but we had already arranged to meet friends in the city.</p>

<p>We grabbed one of the ferries up the Thames to Greenwich - this is great for nice views of Big Ben, the Tower of London, and the Tower Bridge.</p>

<p>In Greenwich we did a walking tour which took us through the Naval buildings, and explained much of the history of the area. We ended up at the Observatory - the location of the Prime Meridian, and where world time is measured from.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon, we headed into the city to catch up with a few old mates who had moved over from Australia.</p>

<p>We had big plans for our last day in London - we wanted to head to Bath and Stonehenge, but unfortunately we left some of the planning to the last minute and this didn’t end up occurring. This gave us th opportunity to head back into London and do some of the sights we hadn’t got to yet.</p>

<p>We visited the Winston Churchill War Cabinet, and Museum which was fantastic. We then headed to Notting Hill, and down Portabello Road - although being a week day the markets were not overly active.</p>

<p>From here we headed into Oxford and Regent streets - having lunch in a pub in Soho.</p>

<p>Following this we headed to Lester Square and located the nearby Her Majesty’s Theater to catch the ‘Phantom of the Opera’ - which was a great show.</p>

<p>This basically wraps up our time in London - we made sure that we left some things to do next time we come back!</p>

<p>Will try to get some of our London pictures up shortly.</p>
