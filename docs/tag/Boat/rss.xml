Today we headed out early to catch a cruise around three of the Greek islands closest to Athens.</p>

<p>Leaving port this morning at about 8.30am, the sun was up and had a fair sting in it - needless to say we took the opportunity to sit on the outer deck and soak up some of the fine rays.</p>

<p>The first thing that stuck us, once we had left the docks and headed out to sea, was the brilliant blue colour of the water - it was absolutely amazing. People have told us about the water over here, but its something you donâ€™t really appreciate until you see it (and later swim in it :) .</p>

<p>The cruise was just what we both needed - some time to it and do nothing for a while!</p>

We spent some time on each of the islands, and managed to fit a swim in on the last two - in that beautiful clear water.</p>

<p>Unfortunately Laura cut her foot while getting into the water at the second island - but we managed to find a local supermarket and add band aids and antiseptic spray to our current day pack first aid kit - oh and we patched her foot up in the process.</p>

<p>After a great day out, we have just been relating, and doing some washing in the hotel - and trying to plan what tomorrow will bring.</p>
