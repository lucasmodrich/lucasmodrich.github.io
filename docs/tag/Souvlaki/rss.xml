Today is our last full day in Greece, as we fly out tomorrow at lunch time - meaning an early start to make sure we get to the airport on time.</p>

<p>Today was another reasonably relaxed and laid back day - we visited the National History Museum, and ate out for lunch in a lovely street side cafe adorned by fans and misting water to keep us cool.</p>

<p>Lunch started with a traditional glass of Ozzo (for me at least, Laura wasn’t too keen). We followed this with a seafood plater and a lamb souvlaki to share, both were fantastic.</p>

<p>The afternoon was then spent wandering the streets and the market - slowly heading back to the hotel.</p>

<p>We have spent a few hours relaxing in the hotel room, and are now gearing up to begin packing and getting ready for our departure tomorrow morning.</p>

<p>We are also attempting to plan ahead for some of our trip to come - the European and Italian guide books being flicked through rapidly trying to determine the ‘where, what, why, and when’ of the German and Italian stages of our journey - we want to try to be a little prepared from now on in.</p>

<p>We have also put up some more of our picture from our time here in Greece.</p>
