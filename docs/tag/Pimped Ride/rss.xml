	     <p>To kick off my “Only in America” series of posts (I am assuming there will be more than one), I bring to you some pictures of a locally “pimped ride” I came across in the car park of a local mall on my morning walk.<br />

<p>I can only assume, that, much like the unique creatures that evolve in places such as Easter Island, this vehicle has similarly been forced to evolve and adapt to survive in local conditions.  I believe this one is particularly adapted to the snowy and icy conditions that are being experienced in the local area.</p>
