	     <p>So after a long few days of travel, we arrived yesterday evening at what will become our home for the next week - villa <a href="http://www.podereincrociati.it">Podere Incronciati</a> - a traditional Tuscan villa built in 1840 about 20km outside of Siena.</p>

<p>We were welcomed by the owner and offered complimentary wine, cheese, olives, fruit and other nibbles - which was much appreciated after the drive from Rome.</p>

<p>After settling on rooms, we unpacked before hitting the pool to cool down and relax for a bit - which was great in the 38c heat.</p>

<p>Later in the evening we all sat down at a long table outside on the lawn as a group and enjoyed dinner and a few drinks, with a light cooling breeze coming across the field.</p>

<p>We have only been here for a day so far, but we are already totally relaxed - mission accomplished.</p>
