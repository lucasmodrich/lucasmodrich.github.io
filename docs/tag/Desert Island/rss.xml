	     <p>So my last post got me thinking… What are the 5 things I would take to a desert island.</p>

<p>Having now been “stranded” (a term I use extremely loosely) on Day Dream island for two days, I feel I have had enough experience to make a fully qualified answer to the question I pose.</p>

<p>The 5 things I would bring to a desert island are (and bare with me…):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Resort style facilities</li>
  <li>Resort staff</li>
  <li>Enough food to last a lifetime</li>
  <li>Enough grog to last a life time… I’m talking top shelf also. If your stranded you don’t want to go without ;-)</li>
  <li>My best friends (this includes my beautiful wife Laura!). Why should I suffer like this alone ;-)</li>
</ul>

<p>So let me hear your comments.. What would you take?<br />
Serious, or not… Lets hear it.</p>
