The right to privacy is a serious matter, and something that I take very seriously.

I recently published an [article](http://news.retaildirections.com/data-breach-be-aware-and-prepare/) on the newly introduced changes to the Australian Privacy Act which relate to Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB).

You can [read the article in full here.](http://news.retaildirections.com/data-breach-be-aware-and-prepare/)

With regard to your privacy, this blog does not do anything specific to determine who you are or collect personal or identifiable information about you. I simply don't need to know. It must be stated however that this Blog is hosted with Wordpress and they may collect certain information about your visit to this and other blogs. I would refer you to the [Wordpress.com](https://wordpress.com) privacy statement for further details.

Again, just to be clear, I am not interested in your data and have no reason to collect it.
