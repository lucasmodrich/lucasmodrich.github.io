<p>So it appears they are coming thick and fast...</p>
<p>In my second "Only in America" post, I want to cover what appears to be an emerging "extreme sport" in the local area - The <a title="Krispy Kreme Challenge" href="http://www.krispykremechallenge.com">Krispy Kreme Challenge</a>.</p>
<p>So, what exactly is the Krispy Kreme Challenge? Â I think they describe the challenge best on their own <a title="Krispy Kreme Challenge" href="http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/ourstory">web site</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>2400 calories, 12 doughnuts, 5 miles, 1 hour. The mantra of the Krispy Kreme Challenge epitomizes the test of physical fitness and gastrointestinal fortitude.</p></blockquote>
<p>The event, which began back in 2004 as a dare between a few NC state university under graduates, has now become an annual event and raises money for the NC Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>The event basically unfolds as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height:12px;">Start out by running 2.5 miles to the local Krispy Kreme store</span></li>
<li>Get into Krispy Kreme and eat 12 glazed doughuts</li>
<li>Complete the course by running a further 2.5 miles</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I wont be around to participate in this years event.</p>
