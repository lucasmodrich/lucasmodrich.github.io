Its been a little while since our last blog post... but good news! We will soon be on the move again - and that means lots of new content over the next month and a half...

Also, we are moving home... well not us, but this Blog.  While our current home has served us incredibly well over the past few years, we thought it was time for a change.

Don't worry - there is nothing you need to do. You will still be able to find us here at [modrich.com](http://modrich.com) - that won't change.  Just next time you visit, things might look... well... a bit different (but hopefully for the better).
