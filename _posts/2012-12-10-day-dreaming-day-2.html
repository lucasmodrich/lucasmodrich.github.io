<p>Another sun filled day in paradise... well on Day Dream Island at least.</p>
<p>After a slightly cloudy and overcast morning, the day had turned out superbly.</p>
<p>Laura did here obligatory site inspection (as a travel agent, it's part of the deal). Meanwhile I walked to the other end of the island in search of water and water holding appliances - of which we are now owners of.</p>
<p>Today was our swimming/snorkelling day. We hired our equipment, and living on the edge as we do, we went without the recommended stinger suits.  While it is currently stinger season, I suspected its more of "would you like fries with that..." season.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we swam, we sore, we didn't get stung... On the body or in the wallet...</p>
<p>After picking up our gear we walked to the south end of he island and found the rainforest walk - with lots of nice outlooks over the water to neighbouring islands.  The rainforest walk leads down to Lovers Cove, one of the better secluded beaches on the island - and only open to guests.</p>
<p>While the fish and coral are not comparable to the outer reef, what we saw was still nice, and the bath temperature water makes the whole experience much more enjoyable.</p>
<p>Lunch was somewhat an involved process. Somehow we got forgotten... Oops... And buy the time we got our meal (a gin &amp; tonic, vodka &amp;amp cranberry, and 2 beers later), we were too hungry to complain that Laura's meal, while close, wasn't exactly what she ordered.  Something we will get over...</p>
<p>Pool time next, and a few more refreshing beverages lead to a great, and relaxing afternoon.</p>
<p>Now we find ourselves relaxing on our balcony, looking out across the resort and the ocean view with a bottle of sparking, and some subtle Afro Cuban All Stars playing off an iPhone in the background.  Couldn't really find a better way to chill out for an afternoon.</p>
