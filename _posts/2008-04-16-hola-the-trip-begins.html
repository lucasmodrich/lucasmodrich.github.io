<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>After a reasonable, but long flight we touched down in Santiago yesterday afternoon (14th). After some sleep, we had our first dinner here, which consisted of a packet of Corn chips &amp; a bottle of local red wine called ´Carmen´ - made the choice easy.</p>
<p>After some more sleep last night we had a light breakfast where we are staying, and have headed out to try and get a feel for the place. Hope to do some tours during the week to see the sights, etc.</p>
<p>The city is reasonably nice. We are staying in the european area, which has nice buildings and cobble stone streets. The rest of the city is basically like any other - very busy. The smog here is noticable, although not too bad.</p>
<p>We hope to have some photos up here shortly.</p>
