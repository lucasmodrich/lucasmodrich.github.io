<p>So my last post got me thinking... What are the 5 things I would take to a desert island.</p>
<p>Having now been "stranded" (a term I use extremely loosely) on Day Dream island for two days, I feel I have had enough experience to make a fully qualified answer to the question I pose.</p>
<p>The 5 things I would bring to a desert island are (and bare with me...):</p>
<li>Resort style facilities</li>
<li>Resort staff</li>
<li>Enough food to last a lifetime</li>
<li>Enough grog to last a life time... I'm talking top shelf also. If your stranded you don't want to go without ;-)</li>
<li>My best friends (this includes my beautiful wife Laura!). Why should I suffer like this alone ;-)</li>
<p>So let me hear your comments.. What would you take?<br />
Serious, or not... Lets hear it.</p>
