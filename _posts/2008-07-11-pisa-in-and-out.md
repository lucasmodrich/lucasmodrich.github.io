[![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/pisa-leaning-tower.jpg?w=225 "Pisa - Leaning tower")](http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/07/11/pisa-in-and-out/pisa-leaning-tower/)On our way from Certaldo to Cinque Terre we made a very brisk stop over in Pisa for the obligatory photos...

To be honest, we're not sure what else, besides the leaning tower, that this town has to offer. Many others we have met suggested it wasn't worth saying here, and that you could see all you needed to in an hour or two - we took their advice, and were in an out of Pisa in about an hour and a half, having satisfied our curiosity.
