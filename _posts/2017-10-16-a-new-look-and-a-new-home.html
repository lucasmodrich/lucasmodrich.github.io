<p>We have finished renovating our old home here at Wordpress.com, and have now moved back in. The old place at SquareSpace is still lingering, but will soon disappear for good.</p>
<p>Over the course of the past few weeks (or weekends rather) there has been a lot of work happening in the background to make the transition back into our old home as painless as possible... I expect there will be some pain at some point, but for the moment I think I have nailed most things down.</p>
<p>We also moved domain - modrich.com, modrich.com/blog and blog.modrich.com will all get you here - modrich.blog</p>
<p>There hasn't been too much activity or travel to report recently, but we have some exciting trips planned for next year (2019) - so stay tuned.<br />
