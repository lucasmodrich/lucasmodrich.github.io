So today is our last day in Santiago. We started out by heading to the post office to send off a few post cards to family back home. Right next to the post office in the Plaza de Armas is a huge old church where we went to mass.

From there we went onto the Marceto Centro (the central market) which is basically a cut down version of the Victoria Market in Melbourne.

Next onto the Museum of Pre-Colombian times. This was great - a lot of history and really interesting artifacts to view from the Aztec, Mays & Inca times.

Tonight were off for our last meal in Santiago, and a few drinks before an early flight to Lima, Peru tomorrow morning.

Again, there are a few more pictures up in our Santiago gallery - enjoy :)
