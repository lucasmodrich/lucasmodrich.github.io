So day three of our stay on Day Dream Island has come, and now almost past.

Today was made up of not a lot, but all of which was thoroughly relaxing.

After a late breakfast, we headed over to "Lovers Cove" for some more snorkelling. It was a clear morning so the visibility was incredible.

After our snorkelling, we lounged on the deck at Lovers Cove looking out over the ocean gathering a few rays of sun, before heading back pool-side once the bar had opened.

Mid-morning and early afternoon were spent in and out of the pool, before retreating back to the room to ready for a surprise that Laura had organised for us in the afternoon.

2pm came around, and we headed off to the day spa for the couples indulgence relaxation package - 2.5hrs of indulgent massage, and spa therapy to really wind-down at the end of a quick break.

It must have been good because, I found myself drifting in and out of sleep during the entire session... Could also have been something to do with the champagne before, during, and after ;-)

It was an amazing way to top off 3 days away, and a great surprise from my wife.

This evening, we find ourselves looking out over the ocean on the southern end of Day Dream Island, watching the sun go down, waiting for tonight's open air movie to start - wonder if we will make it more than 5min tonight...
