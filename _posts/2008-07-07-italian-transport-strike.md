Despite all efforts to plan and schedule the Italian leg of our trip, there is nothing we can do about a public transport strike.

The strike incorporates buses, trains, and planes - so we aren't going anywhere! We were meant to leave Bologna today for San Gimiamo, but this will have to wait until tomorrow.

So today is a forced day of relaxation in the Bolognese country side - we can't even get into town as we rely on the local bus service.
