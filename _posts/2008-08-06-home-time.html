<p>We made it back to Bangkok from Phuket, and are ready to board our flight back home to Australia!It's hard to believe that after 4 months it's finaly home time... It had to happen, and we are both ready for it.</p>
<p>I think our flight is about 8 or 9 hours to Sydney, where we get a domestic back to Melbourne - and onto the final stage of our trip, Bairnsdale.</p>
<p>Anyway, we will see you all soon. It shouldn't be too hard to spot us - we are the ones with the lovely European tans!</p>
