<p><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/05/06/cuzco-here-we-come/peru-in-the-andies/" rel="attachment wp-att-432"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-432" title="Peru - In the Andies" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/peru-in-the-andies.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>So after another long bus ride across the Andean country side we arrived in Cuzco yesterday afternoon - and what a relief this was. The 7 hour bus ride across Peruvian highways that at times were as smooth as a bad gravel road was wearing thin - plus our butts were sore from sitting for so long ;).</p>
<p>Cuzco really is the oasis we have been waiting for - its downtown region is really old and beautiful with a definateÂ European feel. The icing on the cake for us is that we are sort of starting to feel better!</p>
<p>We have a couple of free days here to explore and get to know the city - which we are both looking forward to.</p>
<p>Last night consisted of locating an old English style pub, consuming a few lagers, and then heading up the road for a bowl of creamed tomato soup (all the soup over here seems to be creamed - its hard to get a simple chicken broth, etc).</p>
<p>Today we are going to head out to the local produce markets, which should be very interesting and present a few good photo opportunities I hope.</p>
<p>If I get some free time later this afternoon, I will try to work on getting some of the other photos put up, but this will take time as I need to re-size, etc.</p>
