<p>So its now late evening in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I have checked into my hotel after some 26 hours of travel.</p>
<p>The fleeting moments that I saw of both Los Angeles (airport) and Atlanta (airport) have not really left much of a lasting impression.  LA was busy, and the queues started from the moment you left your seat on the plane.  Atlanta was somewhat more organised and low key - however it was later in the day.  Raleigh was almost closed.</p>
<p>Stepping outside the Raleigh airport onto the sidewalk to get a cab - the 0c temperature forced me to raid my bag for in search for my beanine - its cold compared to Melbourne this time of year.  There were even small clumps of snow/ice on the runway as we taxied into the airport.</p>
<p>Tired and smelly, I checked into my room and headed downstairs to catch a quick meal before the kitchen closed for the night.  A tasty quesadilla and a few locally brewed "North Carolina Pale Ales" has seen me contented for the evening.</p>
<p>The remainder of the evening will no doubt be lost to sleep.  Who knows what tomorrow will hold, but with a maximum forecast temperature of only 7c, I have no doubt it will involve my new thermals, beanie and jumpers.</p>
