<p><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/06/13/a-slow-boat-on-the-aegean/greece-cruise/" rel="attachment wp-att-405"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-405" title="Greece - Cruise" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/greece-cruise.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>Today we headed out early to catch a cruise around three of the Greek islands closest to Athens.</p>
<p>Leaving port this morning at about 8.30am, the sun was up and had a fair sting in it - needless to say we took the opportunity to sit on the outer deck and soak up some of the fine rays.</p>
<p>The first thing that stuck us, once we had left the docks and headed out to sea, was the brilliant blue colour of the water - it was absolutely amazing. People have told us about the water over here, but its something you don't really appreciate until you see it (and later swim in it :) ).</p>
<p>The cruise was just what we both needed - some time to it and do nothing for a while!</p>

<p>Unfortunately Laura cut her foot while getting into the water at the second island - but we managed to find a local supermarket and add band aids and antiseptic spray to our current day pack first aid kit - oh and we patched her foot up in the process.</p>
<p>After a great day out, we have just been relaing, and doing some washing in the hotel - and trying to plan what tomorrow will bring.</p>
