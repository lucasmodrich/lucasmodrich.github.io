<p><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/04/20/our-last-day-in-santiago/chile-santiago-markets/" rel="attachment wp-att-449"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-449" title="Chile - Santiago Markets" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/chile-santiago-markets.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>So today is our last day in Santiago. We started out by heading to the post office to send off a few post cards to family back home. Right next to the post office in the Plaza de Armas is a huge old church where we went to mass.</p>
<p>From there we went onto the Marceto Centro (the central market) which is basically a cut down version of the Victoria Market in Melbourne.</p>
<p>Next onto the Museum of Pre-Colombian times. This was great - a lot of history and really interesting artifacts to view from the Aztec, Mays &amp; Inca times.</p>
<p>Tonight were off for our last meal in Santiago, and a few drinks before an early flight to Lima, Peru tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Again, there are a few more pictures up in our Santiago gallery - enjoy :)</p>
