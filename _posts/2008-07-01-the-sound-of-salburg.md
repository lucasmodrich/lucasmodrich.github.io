We pick-up here were our last post left off. We have arrived in Salzburg – and its the night of the Euro Cup 2008 final, Germany -v- Spain. With Austria being the hosts, we were in for a big night (it had already been a long day... whats a few more hours).

We headed out to the old city, about a 15min walk from where we were staying. A large Fan Zone had been set up in the city's main square with two huge screens, a stage, and of course heaps of beer tents.

We decided to relax a little (after our huge day) before venturing back to the Fan Zone. We found a beer garden not far away from the center of town that was showing the game on plasma screens, grabbed a table and some dinner and relaxed with a few local Austrian beers for a few hours.

After half time we decided to head up to the main square and join in the other fans to watch the last half of the game. At this stage Spain was up 1-0 over Germany.

The main square was packed to capacity – there were people everywhere. The game was eventually won by Spain – to the delight of many in attendance. The crowd erupted in cheering and chanting. It has been over 20 years since Spain has won a title at the European level – so this was a big thing.

We vacated the square and began heading home – along with the majority of the German supporters.

We were up early again the following morning as we had booked onto the 9am Sound of Music tour around Salzburg. The tour took us through much of Salzburg, and showed us many of the places that were used in the filming of the movie – Laura was in her element. The tour also took us out of town to the lakes district, and to some absolutely beautiful scenery. We had a short stop over in a small town with just enough time to have a coffee and sample some apple strudel, which was divine, before getting back on the bus and heading back to Salzburg to complete the tour.

We spent the afternoon exploring the Salzburg castle/fortress, which is the predominant feature in Salzburg, and can be seen from nearly anywhere in the city.

After this we headed to another beer garden – this one was run by monks, and was established in 1621. They had a pretty impressive setup. Walking in from the street the place doesn't look like much – then you wander down some passage ways, and steps and come to a corridor with local food stalls. Further on you emerge into a massive beer garden.

We relaxed in the beer garden for the afternoon and sampled some of the monks beer, which is drawn straight from the barrel, and was, as with most beer over here, great.

Later we headed home to get some rest, as we were off early in the morning to Venice, Italy! The start of the Italian leg of our journey.
