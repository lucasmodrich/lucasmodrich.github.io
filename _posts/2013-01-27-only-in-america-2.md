So it appears they are coming thick and fast...

In my second "Only in America" post, I want to cover what appears to be an emerging "extreme sport" in the local area - The [Krispy Kreme Challenge](http://www.krispykremechallenge.com "Krispy Kreme Challenge").

So, what exactly is the Krispy Kreme Challenge? &nbsp;I think they describe the challenge best on their own [web site](http://www.krispykremechallenge.com/ourstory "Krispy Kreme Challenge"):

> 2400 calories, 12 doughnuts, 5 miles, 1 hour. The mantra of the Krispy Kreme Challenge epitomizes the test of physical fitness and gastrointestinal fortitude.

The event, which began back in 2004 as a dare between a few NC state university under graduates, has now become an annual event and raises money for the NC Children's Hospital.

The event basically unfolds as follows:

- Start out by running 2.5 miles to the local Krispy Kreme store
- Get into Krispy Kreme and eat 12 glazed doughuts
- Complete the course by running a further 2.5 miles

Unfortunately, I wont be around to participate in this years event.
