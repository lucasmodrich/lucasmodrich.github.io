So its now late evening in Raleigh, North Carolina, and I have checked into my hotel after some 26 hours of travel.

The fleeting moments that I saw of both Los Angeles (airport) and Atlanta (airport) have not really left much of a lasting impression. &nbsp;LA was busy, and the queues started from the moment you left your seat on the plane. &nbsp;Atlanta was somewhat more organised and low key - however it was later in the day. &nbsp;Raleigh was almost closed.

Stepping outside the Raleigh airport onto the sidewalk to get a cab - the 0c temperature forced me to raid my bag for in search for my beanine - its cold compared to Melbourne this time of year. &nbsp;There were even small clumps of snow/ice on the runway as we taxied into the airport.

Tired and smelly, I checked into my room and headed downstairs to catch a quick meal before the kitchen closed for the night. &nbsp;A tasty quesadilla and a few locally brewed "North Carolina Pale Ales" has seen me contented for the evening.

The remainder of the evening will no doubt be lost to sleep. &nbsp;Who knows what tomorrow will hold, but with a maximum forecast temperature of only 7c, I have no doubt it will involve my new thermals, beanie and jumpers.
