So the Day Dream begins...

Waking up at 4am this morning, making the chilly journey out to the airport, we have flown north to Hamilton Island, and are now sitting on the upper deck of the ferry that will take us to Day Dream Island.

While the weather is somewhat overcast, with the very odd dot of rain here and there, it is still very warm, and quite hot when the sun breaks through. The first challenge will be to not get sunburnt on our transfer across to Day Dream.
