excerpt: So I have been in Durban for a few days now. Mostly work meetings with  clients
  and not much down time to get out and see the place (im not hear for leasure!).We
  have ventured out and visited a number of the local cafes to grab a meal here and
  there and to get out of the hotel - but for the most nothing beyond the walls of
  the compound we are staying in or the offices of our clients.

<p>So I have been in Durban for a few days now. Mostly work meetings with clients and not much down time to get out and see the place (im not hear for leisure!).</p>
<p>We have ventured out and visited a number of the local cafes to grab a meal here and there and to get out of the hotel - but for the most nothing beyond the walls of the compound we are staying in or the offices of our clients.</p>
<p>We did get out to the local shopping centre one evening to visit out client retail outlet and to get a better feel for their operation - but again - this was not a social visit.</p>

<p>We are staying about 20km north of the Durban CBD itself - and the are is a mix of residential and industrial.</p>
<p>The weather has been quite nice - around 22c each day and down to about 12c over night.  Very pleasant compared to the brisk mornings we have had in Melbourne recently.</p>
<p>Today is actually a public holiday here in South Africa - so I am using the local down time to put together my notes  session earlier in the week and to plan and pre for the remainder of the week ahead.</p>
<p>Given the nice weather, I decided that today my office would be the back deck of the hotel where we are staying it - nice warm sunshine, a good view across the lake to the 18th hole of the local golf course (looks like a lovely day for a round!) and plenty of monkeys and mongoose to keep me company.</p>
<p>This afternoon, we took some time out to venture out and take a drive through Durban and the surrounding area on the way to an early dinner.</p>
<p>Durban downtown was a mix of new and old buildings - and I have the feeling some areas that you really don't want to get too close to. We passed through quickly and headed back north to the beach suburb of Umhlanga - which was quite nice and obviously a more wealthy part of town.</p>
