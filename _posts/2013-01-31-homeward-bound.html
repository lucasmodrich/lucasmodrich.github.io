<p>This morning I find myself at Raleigh Airport (RDU) waiting to board a plane - a few days ahead of my original return schedule.</p>
<p>Due to some family medical issues back home, I have decided to cut my trip short and head home early.</p>
<p>Most of last night was spent rearranging flights. I'm now flying home via Detroit and LA back into Melbourne. It's going to be a long haul, but with only about 4 hours sleep last night, I'm hoping to sleep well during the flights.</p>
<p>Well America - it's been short, but its been fun... I even got to experience a "Tornado Watch" last night with high winds and tornado threats moving through the Raleigh area yesterday and overnight.</p>
