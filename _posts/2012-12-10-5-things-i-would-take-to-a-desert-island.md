So my last post got me thinking... What are the 5 things I would take to a desert island.

Having now been "stranded" (a term I use extremely loosely) on Day Dream island for two days, I feel I have had enough experience to make a fully qualified answer to the question I pose.

The 5 things I would bring to a desert island are (and bare with me...):

- Resort style facilities
- Resort staff
- Enough food to last a lifetime
- Enough grog to last a life time... I'm talking top shelf also. If your stranded you don't want to go without ;-)
- My best friends (this includes my beautiful wife Laura!). Why should I suffer like this alone ;-)

So let me hear your comments.. What would you take?  
Serious, or not... Lets hear it.
