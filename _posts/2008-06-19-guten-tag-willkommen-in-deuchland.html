<p><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/guten-tag-willkommen-in-deuchland/bremen-becks/" rel="attachment wp-att-397"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-397" title="Bremen - Becks" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bremen-becks.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>So we are in Germany now – having arrived from Tampere, Finland into Bremen the other day. We have been in Bremen for the last few days, staying with friends (Suzanne &amp; Richard) in their lovely apartment which is just a short ride from the heart of Bremen.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">We quickly realised that the Euro 2008 Cup (soccer) is in progress – and on the night we arrived Germany were facing off with Austria (the hosts), and it was a must win type of situation for Germany to allow them to progress through.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Suzanne and Richards apartment is conveniently located above a nice little bar – so we headed down stairs with some of their work friends for meal and a few drinks to watch the game – ending with Germany winning 2-0... needless to say the Germans were rather pleased!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The next day we headed out into Bremen on bikes we borrowed from Suzanne &amp; Richard. This was th best way to get around town – everyone here rides, and the place is so flat its perfect (it also lets you cover more ground).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Coming into Bremen we new little about the city – we quickly discovered that its the home of the Beck's Brewery (and this stuff is cheaper than water over here – 4 Euros for 3 liters at the supermarket!). Its also the home of the Traveling Musicians from the Brothers Grimm fairy tail (a donkey, dog, cat and a rooster).</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;"><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/06/19/guten-tag-willkommen-in-deuchland/bremen-city/" rel="attachment wp-att-398"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-398" title="Bremen - City" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bremen-city.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>The old town has some classically beautiful German architecture – Churches, and other lovely old style buildings.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Riding into Bremen, we hit the Market Platz – basically the center of town, with lovely cafe's, buildings, and markets all skirting the main plaza.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">After a quick coffee, we continued riding in search of the Beck's brewery. This was a little way up the river – unfortunately tours are only made on Thursday's and Fridays.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">We road back towards town down the side of the river – heading past the many Bier Gartens (Beer Gardens) that are on the riverside. This got the better of us (well me), and we decided to take 5 in one of the Bier Gartens and sample some of the local beers – oh and a freshly cooked pretzel or two.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">The following day we were lucky enough to have a local guide, Suzanne, to show us around. As it happened, Suzanne was actually meant to be heading out of town for a few days on business, but the night before she was dew to fly out she had a minor dental emergency with one of her teeth cracking – needless to say this put a halt to her business trip.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">So while it worked out fairly we for us, it wasn't so good for Suzanne – but a quick trip to the dentist the next morning she returned minus a tooth, and with a rather numb mouth.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Suzanne took us out to the Burgerpark – a huge area of park land in Bremen – which was great. We pulled up at a little cafe in the middle of the park for some lunch, and a chance to sample some more of the local beer – Green Lemon (basically lime) Becks, Weissbier and Banana Juice (which was actually reasonably good), and the local favorite Haake Becks.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Later we walked back into town and sampled some of the local torte (cake) – my favorite being the German baked cheese cake!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">We then toured through some of the small cute side streets in Bremen before heading home.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0;">Today we have jumped on the ICE (Inter City Express) train from Bremen to Berlin (about 3 hours). These trains are awesome – traveling at over 250km on a smooth as silk line it barely any noise from outside – there is defiantly something to be said for good German engineering!</p>
