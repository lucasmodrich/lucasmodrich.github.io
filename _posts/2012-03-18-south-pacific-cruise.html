<p>By this time next week we will be cruising in the middle of the South Pacific - sun, sea breeze, and the obligatory beer/cocktail.</p>
<p>The cruise will take us on a whirlwind 7 nights through the South Pacific visiting Vanuatu, Noumea and the Isle of Pines on the way. Cruising is a completely new experience for us and can't wait to leave dock next Saturday.</p>
<p>No doubt we will have some great photos to share from the cruise, so I will post them once we return.</p>
<p>Check out the cruise details here:Â <a title="P&amp;O - Week Fantastique" href="http://www.pocruises.com.au/findacruise/pages/CruiseProfile.aspx?CruiseCode=W211N">P&amp;O - Week Fantastique</a></p>
