So Laura and I will be heading off to Turkey in a few weeks. &nbsp;While Laura has been to Turkey twice previously, this will put a tick in the "done" column on my travel bucket list.

The more people we talk to about Turkey, the better it sounds - I haven't met anyone yet with a bad story, and actually all the stories I have heard sound fantastic.

It will be a reasonably whirlwind trip this time, about 11 days in total made up of 2 days in Kuala Lumpur on the way over, then the rest of our time in Turkey being mainly&nbsp;concentrated in Istanbul with an overnight trip to Gallipoli (to see the ANZAC war memorials and battle fields) and historic Troy.

So as our&nbsp;preparations&nbsp;continue, the excitement is building - and the clock is ticking until we leave. &nbsp;While in Istanbul I am planning on taking a lot of photos - what is there not to like about a city so full of vibrant colours, culture and postcard like scenes such as&nbsp; the Blue Mosque, the Grand Bazaar, the Spice Bazaar, and the Ayasofya.

With luck we will have internet access during our trip, so I will be able to sit back in the evenings enjoying a refreshing local beverage or two, possibly smoking on a Shisha Pipe, and reflect on the events of the day to distil the essence of our day into a blog post.

Until then... elveda &nbsp;(goodbye in Turkish -&nbsp;according&nbsp;to Google translate at least :) )
