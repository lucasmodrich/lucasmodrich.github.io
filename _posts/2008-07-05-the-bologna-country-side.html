<p><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/07/05/the-bologna-country-side/bolonga/" rel="attachment wp-att-368"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-368" title="Bolonga" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bolonga.jpg?w=225" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>We arrived in Bologna yesterday afternoon, after a short train trip from Venice (2 hours). We managed to navigate the local bus system with the help of a local and shortly after arrived at our B&amp;B which is located in the country side hills overlooking farmland and the city - about 15 minutes drive out of town.</p>
<p>Its absolutely beautiful here. The relaxing surroundings, the peacefulness of the Italian country side... Its just what we needed - a change from staying in city's.</p>
<p>After a relaxed afternoon of sitting on our balcony overlooking the country side, and having a few refreshing beers... and a nap... it was time for dinner out on the patio where we could watch the sun setting over Bologna.</p>
<p><a href="http://modrich.wordpress.com/2008/07/05/the-bologna-country-side/bolonga-feast/" rel="attachment wp-att-369"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-369" title="Bolonga - Feast" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/bolonga-feast.jpg?w=300" alt="" width="300" height="225" /></a>We selected the local traditional plater and a salad to share for dinner, which was made up of all local produce including; salami, prosciutto, mortadela (which originated here in Bologna), dips and sauces, pickled peppers, pickled onions, pork fat, parmesan, and two types of bread - one a fried flat bread, and the other a small hard bread (resembling a hard flat scone). Our meal was accompanied by a glass or two of wine, and some conversation with the owner.</p>

<p>Today we have plans to catch the bus into town and look around. Bologna - what we saw briefly of it yesterday - appears to be a lovely city with lots to see, and it has a reputation for amazing local food (Parma - where Parma ham is from, and Modena - where the fine Balsamic is from, are both just up the road).</p>
