This morning I find myself at Raleigh Airport (RDU) waiting to board a plane - a few days ahead of my original return schedule.

Due to some family medical issues back home, I have decided to cut my trip short and head home early.

Most of last night was spent rearranging flights. I'm now flying home via Detroit and LA back into Melbourne. It's going to be a long haul, but with only about 4 hours sleep last night, I'm hoping to sleep well during the flights.

Well America - it's been short, but its been fun... I even got to experience a "Tornado Watch" last night with high winds and tornado threats moving through the Raleigh area yesterday and overnight.
