By this time next week we will be cruising in the middle of the South Pacific - sun, sea breeze, and the obligatory beer/cocktail.

The cruise will take us on a whirlwind 7 nights through the South Pacific visiting Vanuatu, Noumea and the Isle of Pines on the way. Cruising is a completely new experience for us and can't wait to leave dock next Saturday.

No doubt we will have some great photos to share from the cruise, so I will post them once we return.
