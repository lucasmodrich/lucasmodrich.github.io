So we hit the ground running in our first day on Day Dream Island, and went straight into relaxation overdrive.

The day pretty much rolled on as follows:

- leisurely stroll around the island
- lunch
- cocktails by the pool
- cocktails in the pool
- cocktails by the beach
- cocktails in the lounge
- relaxation hydrotherapy session
- dinner right at the beach front, with an amazing view out across the water
- open air cinema with some popcorn as a few beers

After a 4am start, we quickly discovered ourselves succumbing to the effects of the early start and the relaxing effects of the day - both of us were out like a light at the open air cinema, 5min into the move ;-)

Needless to say, after a brief stroll home, our first day ended there - it was 8pm.
